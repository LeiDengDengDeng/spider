BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top insurance watchdog will conduct inspections to rectify market irregularities and protect consumer interests, according to an official statement released Monday.
From June to mid-October, local insurance authorities will conduct on-site investigations on 46 branches of 16 insurance entities, as well as seven part-time insurance agents, which had been ranked poorly in terms of customer complaints in the past two years, China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in the statement.
The inspections will focus on violations including fraudulent sales practices, fake or absent customer information, and failure to pay small insurance claims efficiently.
In addition, the insurance regulator will conduct case-by-case investigations into violations reported by the public, and punish typical behavior that hurts customer interests.
"We will never compromise on matters of principle, and we will not disregard violations for any reason," the regulator said in a statement.
The statement also called for toughened supervision on innovative insurance businesses, and said authorities will work to standardize sales behavior not only by insurance firms, but by agents and intermediaries.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Net foreign exchange sales by China's central bank and financial institutions continued to slow in April in a sign of easing capital outflows, official data showed Monday.
China sold 42 billion yuan (6.1 billion U.S. dollars) worth of foreign exchange in April, retreating from 54.7 billion yuan in March and 58.1 billion yuan in February, according to data from the People's Bank of China.
As the Chinese currency is not freely convertible under the capital account, the central bank has to purchase foreign currency generated by China's trade surplus and foreign investment in the country, adding funds to the money market.
The narrowing decline indicated easing pressure from capital flight as the Chinese economy firms up and the yuan stabilizes against the U.S. dollar.
Official data showed China forex reserves climbing to 3.0295 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of April from 3.0091 trillion dollars a month earlier.
This was the first time since June 2014 the reserves expanded for three consecutive months.

Shares related to the Belt and Road Initiative recorded robust performance, with Beijing Hengtong Innovation Luxwood Technology up by the daily limit of 10 percent to 26.2 yuan.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies on Monday signed a contract with Kazakhstan's national railway company to buy 49 percent of an inland port near the China-Kazakhstan border.
China COSCO Shipping Corporation and Jiangsu Lianyungang Port Co. will each hold 24.5 percent of the dry port located in the Khorgos-East Gate special economic zone, according to a statement from China COSCO Shipping.
The dry port is about 15 km from the Khorgos port in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on the border of the two countries. From the port, railway cargo can reach Lianyungang in east China's Jiangsu in five days and reach Europe in about 10 days.
Xu Lirong, chairman of China COSCO Shipping, said the dry port is the company's first overseas railway investment project since the corporation was established.
The company aims to build it into an important trade passageway and a model project for China and Kazakhstan under the Belt and Road Initiative.
China COSCO Shipping is a state-owned company set up in early 2016 after the merger of COSCO and China Shipping.

Economic Watch: Chinese economy shows firming signs amid restructuring efforts

2017-05-15 16:37:52
Editor: ying
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A slew of upbeat economic data pointed to latest restructuring achievements and provided fresh stabilization signs for the Chinese economy.
Highly-watched economic figures released Monday, including industrial output, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and housing sales, confirmed the message that the ongoing growth model transitioning is providing new impetus to the world's second largest economy.
In the first four months, total retail sales of consumer goods rose 10.2 percent year on year, 0.2 percentage points faster than the growth in the first quarter, buttressed by vigorous consumption growth in rural areas and online shopping, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Monday.
Retail sales rose 12.1 percent in rural areas during the same period, outpacing urban areas, where retail sales climbed 9.9 percent. Online retail sales surged 32 percent year on year in the first four months.
"The figures indicate continued growth of domestic consumer demand, which was partly driven by consumption upgrades and new business patterns such as online sales," said NBS spokesperson Xing Zhihong.
China is moving toward an economy boosted by consumer spending, innovation and services, reducing reliance on investment and exports of low value-added goods and narrowing the income gap between urban and rural dwellers.
China's GDP growth in Q1 stood at 6.9 percent, up slightly from 6.8 percent in the previous quarter, with 77.2 percent of that driven by consumption, 12.6 percentage points higher than the 2016 level. The service sector rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, outpacing a 3-percent increase in agriculture and 6.4 percent in secondary industries.
Property investment growth remained robust and the inventory trended down. Investment in real estate development increased 9.3 percent year on year from January to April, 0.2 percentage points faster than the growth rate registered in the first quarter.
At the end of April, 674.7 million square meters of property remained unsold in China, decreasing by 13.4 million square meters from the end of March.
In a similar vein, China's value-added industrial output rose 6.5 percent year on year in April, 0.5 percentage points higher than the same month last year, while profits at industrial enterprises above the designated size surged 28.3 percent year on year in the first quarter.
High-tech and low-carbon products witnessed faster production growth in the first four months, with the production volumes of industrial robots and solar batteries surging 51.7 percent and 18.2 percent, respectively, Xing said at a press conference.
"China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth continues," the World Bank said in a recent report, noting that economic growth will continue to moderate as capacity is cut and credit kept on a tight leash.
As of Monday, 31.7 million tonnes of steel and iron capacity and 69 million tonnes of coal capacity have been cut, accounting for 63.4 percent and 46 percent of the annual targets, respectively, Xing said.
China's investment in fixed assets rose 8.9 percent year on year in the first four months of 2017, easing pace from 9.2 percent in the first quarter but reflecting the ongoing restructuring of the economy, as investment growth rate in the service sector far exceeded the industrial sector.
Investment in the industrial sector rose only 3.5 percent in the first four months, a main drag on total investment growth, while investment in the service sector rose 12.1 percent.
The robust economic growth momentum has supported job creation and new business registration. Some 4.65 million new jobs were created in the first four months, 220,000 more than the same period last year, and 556,000 new companies were registered in April alone.
China still has a long list of reform tasks, many intertwined with one another, which when added to global risks like U.S. interest rate increases and protectionism makes policy-making tricky, analysts said.
"The economy continued to stabilize and positive factors were increasing. But both domestic and international environment is still complicated and structural contradictions have not been fundamentally eased," said Xing.
China should continue to reduce excess capacity, curb credit, lower debt leverage in the corporate sector and reform state-owned enterprises, said Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region.
"Against the backdrop of the ongoing financial regulatory tightening, we may see a 'soft-patch' of economic data in the next couple of months amidst reduced inflationary expectations and rising risk premium," investment firm China International Capital Corporation said in a research note.

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, announced Monday that it has set up a fintech committee to enhance research, planning and coordination of work on financial technology.
In order to make strategic plans and provide policy guidance on fintech development, the PBOC said it will further study its influence on monetary policy, financial markets, financial stability, payment and clearing.
"Fintech, or technology-driven financial innovation, has both injected vitality into financial development and brought new challenges to financial security," said the bank in a statement on its website.
The central bank will devise a management mechanism for fintech innovation to handle relations between security and development and guide the proper use of new technology in the financial field.
The central bank will also increase the use of regulatory technology, or "regtech," to boost its capabilities in identifying, preventing and dissolving financial risks, including both cross-sector and cross-market risks, with technology such as big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, it said.

TIANJIN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch innovator whose seven-meter-tall air-purifying tower attracted attention worldwide last year said he wants to have the product manufactured in China.
Daan Roosegaarde, designer of the "Smog Free Tower", told Xinhua that he is in talks with a company in north China's Tianjin Municipality.

The tower, originally displayed in Beijing last year, was erected a month ago in Tianjin Minyuan Stadium, where local residents exercise daily.
Xie Xiaohui, president of Tianjin Film-method Works Green Technology, said she was optimistic about air purifiers market prospects.
"A smog-free park with an air-purifier in the center would be welcomed by the public," she said, adding that the company is currently in discussion with Roosegaarde about how to lower the costs.
Roosegaarde said he is also developing a bicycle that will purify the air for its rider. He wants to use similar innovative products to raise public awareness about environmental protection and smog reduction.
The products have triggered discussion on environmental issues, and showed how innovation can encourage change, said Ineke van de Pol, from the Netherlands Embassy in China.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,546 companies, or 66.2 percent of those examined, violated environmental standards during the second round of air pollution inspections, China's environmental authority announced Saturday.
From April 28 to May 11, the second round of air pollution inspections examined 3,846 companies across the country, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP).
Major problems included excessive emissions and failure to install or improper operation of pollution control equipment, the MEP said in a statement.
The central government is fighting pollution and environmental degradation after decades of growth have left the country saddled with problems such as smog and contaminated soil.
Chinese enterprises were fined around 264 million yuan (38 million U.S. dollars) for violating standards in the first quarter of this year, the MEP said last month.
The ministry issued punishments in nearly 5,000 cases related to violations of environmental protection regulations and laws in Q1, up around 200 percent year on year.
In 224 cases, companies had to pay between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan per day after failing to rectify violations within the time frame set by the MEP.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved the IPO applications of 10 companies.
The companies will raise no more than 6.2 billion yuan (899 million U.S. dollars), a statement said late Friday.
Five companies will be listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange, two on the Shenzhen stock market's Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Board and three on the ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board.
The firms and their underwriters will confirm IPO dates and publish prospectuses following discussions with the exchanges.
Under the current IPO system, new shares are subject to approval from the CSRC. China is gradually switching from an approval-based IPO system to a more market-oriented one based on registration.

WELLINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese visitor spending will add 4.3 billion NZ dollars (2.92 billion U.S. dollars) annually to New Zealand's economy by 2023, with China set to become New Zealand's largest tourist market by spend, said Tourism Minister Paula Bennett on Friday.
The figures confirm the importance of China to New Zealand's tourism industry, as the country's tourism sector is forecast to grow significantly, with an estimation of 4.9 million international visitors annually by 2023, who are projected to spend 15.3 billion NZ dollars a year, said Bennett.
Figures from the New Zealand Tourism Forecasts 2017-2023, which was released by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), showed the real value that tourism will continue to have to New Zealand's economy.
The amount visitors spend per day is expected to grow by 9 percent over the forecast period. For New Zealand's second largest market, China, this figure is 17 percent.
"The figures released today (Friday) confirm that New Zealand's tourism sector is in good shape. Visitor arrivals are projected to reach 4.9 million annually by 2023 -- up 39 percent from the 3.5 million visitors who came here in 2016," Bennett said.
She said the government is focused on helping the tourism sector attract visitors who bring value to communities -- those who spend more, stay longer and explore regions around New Zealand, as well as the main tourist spots.
Overall, international visitor spending is forecast to exceed 15 billion NZ dollars annually by 2023, up 52 percent from annual visitor spending of 10 billion NZ dollars in 2016. "This equates to a solid growth rate of over 6 percent per annum, which is great news for our regional economies," Bennett said.
"Tourism is already our biggest export earner, and adds immense value to our country by directly employing over 180,000 people," she said.

China to balance deleveraging, stable liquidity: central bank

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will take steps to balance deleveraging the economy and ensuring market liquidity remains basically stable, the central bank said Friday.
China will enhance coordination in financial regulation to manage the timing and pace of regulations to stabilize market expectations, according to a quarterly monetary policy report released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
Jitters were felt across the stock and bond markets in the past few weeks as China tightened financial regulation to control risks.
A more flexible approach will be taken to liquidity for reasonable credit growth while guarding against over fast credit expansion and rising leverage ratios, the report said.
China's banks issued a combined 1.1 trillion yuan (about 160 billion U.S. dollars) in new yuan loans in April, increasing by 542 billion yuan year on year, PBOC data showed Friday.
The PBOC mulls placing more financial market practices under macro prudential assessment for strict control of liquidity risks and maturity mismatch risks.
Changes of the PBOC's balance sheet are subject to more factors than many central banks of developed economies, the PBOC pointed out.
The shrinkage of the balance sheet in the first quarter is mainly influenced by seasonal and fiscal factors while the balance sheet in April turned into expansion, the PBOC added.

China Focus: A modern Silk Road in the making

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Around 2,000 years ago, merchants and caravans began moving east and west along the Silk Road, trading goods and technology. Now a modern Silk Road, rekindling trade, attracting investment and sharing prosperity, is in the making.
The Belt and Road Initiative has gained enormous traction since it was proposed by China in 2013. It consists of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along, and beyond, the ancient trade routes.
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the highest-level international meeting so far for the initiative, will be held in Beijing on Sunday and Monday, attracting 29 heads of state and government leaders.
"A great many projects have been pushed forward under the canopy of the initiative. Dots have been connected to form the big picture that China envisioned," said Xiang Junyong, a researcher with Renmin University of China who follows the progress of the initiative.
"The main structure of a modern Silk Road has roughly taken shape, through better links between cities along the routes, trade zones, international economic corridors and better ports," said Xiang.
More than 100 countries and international organizations support the initiative. China has signed agreements with at least 40 of them.
China has invested more than 50 billion U.S. dollars in countries involved from 2014 to 2016, official data show.
Fifty-six economic and trade cooperation zones have been built by Chinese businesses in Belt and Road countries, generating nearly 1.1 billion dollars in tax revenue and creating 180,000 local jobs.
NEW VITALITY
"The new Silk Road is by no means a private path for China. Rather, it is a grand avenue that accommodates the prosperity of many nations," said Fang Aiqing, vice commerce minister of China.
When the global economy is troubled by weak growth, weak demand with financial fluctuations lurking round each corner, the Belt and Road Initiative, which targets growth and rebalancing the global economy, is a desirable solution, he said.
"Most countries along the Belt and Road are developing nations and eager for better economic performance and regional economic integration," Fang said.
China's initiative docks with the individual development strategies of different countries, such as Australia, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Poland, Turkey and Vietnam. Railways, ports, oil pipelines and other infrastructure have been built. Cultural, educational, tourism and archaeological exchanges are ongoing.
The Thai-China Industrial Park in Rayong, located some 200 km from Bangkok, is one of the most successful economic zones. It hosts about 90 companies and provides jobs for 20,000 locals.
"We bring advanced technology to local users," said Wang Jianyi, chairman of Chinese optical cable provider Futong Group, which has a plant in the industrial park.
Now every week, some 4,200 direct flights connect China with 43 Belt and Road countries. Railway border procedures have been streamlined, with 39 China-Europe freight train routes currently in operation.
The China-Europe container trains ship goods like laptops, ceramics and oil-drilling equipment to Europe and bring back such things as food, wine and baby formula.
A growing number of companies, both Chinese and foreign, ship their goods through the railway network from cities like Chengdu and Chongqing in China.
"Transportation connectivity is the foundation of the Belt and Road Initiative," said Wu Chungeng of the Ministry of Transport.
China has signed more than 130 bilateral and regional transport agreements, he said.
ANCIENT WISDOM REVISITED
About 1,300 years ago, thousands of retailers and traders gathered at the west and east markets in today's Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. These markets were well known along the ancient Silk Road.
"People brought silk and tea here and took them further on west to the Middle East and Europe. The caravans brought back pepper and cloves," said Wang Bin, curator of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) West Market Museum.
"When the market thrived, it was a time of prosperity and good lives for the people. The west market lasted 320 years before it shrank at the end of the Tang Dynasty," he said.
Under the Belt and Road Initiative, rail services are expanding in Xi'an, and a free trade zone has been set up.
"The ancient Silk Road turned post houses and small oases into great cities, and allowed exchange among the world's greatest civilizations," said He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission.
"We need to remember that when the ancient road was in its prime, China was a rather open nation. Through the Belt and Road Initiative, China aims for further opening-up and common prosperity," he said.
"History can be silent but it never disappears, and it is time to recall past experiences to shape the future," he added.
Global economic recovery in the past few years has been hard and circuitous. International trade and investment are slow, and globalization has met immense challenges.
"Faced with the challenges, we need to draw wisdom from our ancestors and take action to break the stalemate," said the official.
Gubaz Sanikidze, former deputy chairman of the parliament of Georgia, hailed the Belt and Road Initiative as a great modern Silk Road.
"It represents new opportunities and prospects and to some extent, the future of the globe," said Sanikidze, suggesting security issues in some areas need to be considered when the initiative is implemented.
ALL ABOARD THE TECH TRAIN
Chinese companies have increased their investment in countries along the routes, building overseas technological centers and manufacturing bases.
"Chinese companies are developing fast, especially hi-tech firms. Many are ready to create value and spread their technology," said Zhang Xiaodong, head of the Belt and Road industry promotion association at Beijing's Zhongguancun Science Park.
Beijing OriginWater Technology Co. Ltd, specializing in safe water solutions in Zhongguancun, has developed advanced membrane filters to block pollutants and purify water.
The company plans to invest 150 million dollars in a water pollution treatment program in Oman.
"We will pour more investment in Belt and Road countries for deeper cooperation," said He Yuanping, vice president of Beijing OriginWater.
Belt and Road countries need technology. There is a huge potential for cooperation between China's tech parks and those countries, according to the Zhongguancun administration.
Since 2014, Tus-Holdings, based in Beijing, has trained managers and planned industrial parks for countries such as Egypt, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia and Thailand.
"China's high-tech zones, university science parks and incubators have set a good example for other developing countries," said Yang Hongmei, vice president of a Tus-Holdings research academy.

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's electricity consumption, an important indicator of economic activity, increased significantly in April, suggesting economic improvement, official data showed Friday.
Power use rose 6 percent year on year to 484.7 billion kilowatt-hours in April, according to data from the National Energy Administration.
In April, electricity use by primary industries dropped 1.1 percent year on year. Power consumption by secondary industries went up 5 percent, while tertiary industries saw a 12.7-percent rise amid economic restructuring.
In the first four months, power consumption rose 6.7 percent from the same period in 2016 to 1.93 trillion kWh, data showed.
Electricity use in the service sector rose 8.9 percent in the first four months, while the industrial and agricultural sectors saw increases of 6.9 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, according to NEA.
The rates reflect positive changes in China's economic structure, as power use in the service sector grew faster than the industrial sector.

Economic Watch: Regulation, monetary cocktail to keep liquidity stable

Editor: Yamei
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The mutually reinforcing relationship between financial regulation and monetary cocktail will keep China's liquidity basically stable in months ahead, according to analysts.
After a three-day suspension of reverse repos, the central bank renewed cash injections Wednesday as liquidity pressure increased as 190 billion yuan (about 27.5 billion U.S. dollars) of previous reverse repos matured.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 110 billion yuan of reverse repos and pumped 47.6 billion yuan into the market through pledged supplementary lending (PSL), a tool designed which helps the central bank target longer-term rates.
Purchases of short-dated maturities have remained the central bank's main method of stabilizing liquidity, and Wednesday's operations included 90 billion yuan of seven-day reverse repos priced to yield 2.45 percent; 10 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent; and 10 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
Despite the injections, the money market witnessed a net cash withdrawal Wednesday, showing the central bank's intention of tightening things up, at least in the short term.
"The withdrawal can be explained by the recent calmness of inter-bank and exchanging markets," said Chen Yi, researcher with Bank of Communications.
On Thursday, the central bank injected 20 billion yuan of new money, with 80 billion yuan of reverse repos offset by the maturation of another 60 billion yuan.
Capital prices then fell, overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor) by 1.4 basis points to 2.8130 percent.
However, the yield of ten-year treasury bonds rose to 3.7 percent on Thursday.
Bond buyers have been increasingly pessimistic since last year, due to tightened regulation. Yields have climbed because of weak sentiment and tight regulation, according to a research report by Guosen Securities.
"Looking ahead, financial regulation and liquidity control will complement each other, and liquidity will remain basically stable in the coming months," said Chen, adding that short-term inter-bank borrowing costs have only a slim chance of exceeding four percent.

Economic Watch: China determined to push capacity-cut drive
Source: Xinhua
2017-05-11 20:37:00
Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to gain some ground on its key battlefield -- addressing industrial overcapacity.
The phasing out of sub-standard production capacity will continue, especially steel and iron, coal-mining and coal-fired power plants, so that the targets set for the year can and will be achieved, said a statement released after a State Council executive meeting on Wednesday.
By the end of June, all facilities to produce inferior-quality steel bars will be dismantled across the whole country. All coal mines scheduled to close this year will be so by the end of November, as agreed by the attendees of the meeting, which was presided over by Premier Li Keqiang.
As excess capacity has weighed on China's overall economic performance, cutting overcapacity is high on the reform agenda. In 2016, China completed both its annual targets for coal and steel capacity reduction ahead of schedule.
The government work report this year stated that China will continue to cut overcapacity in bloated sectors, with targets to slash steel production capacity by around 50 million tonnes and coal by at least 150 million tonnes this year.
As of Wednesday, 31.7 million tonnes of steel and iron capacity and 68.97 million tonnes of coal capacity had been cut, accounting for 63.4 percent and 46 percent of their annual goals respectively.
While the government scored an initial win, there were a few setbacks and the battle is far from over.
The enthusiasm for the drive is waning with rising demand for steel and coal, difficulty in relocating former employees and digesting the debt, according to Feng Qiaobin with the Chinese Academy of Governance.
China's steel mills have reported good profits since this year as speculators have splurged on higher prices after the government pledged to increase spending on infrastructure construction.
In addition, bowing to government pressure, some firms could just halt production temporarily to meet their assigned tasks, instead of seriously eliminating capacity. Reports of unofficial production in steel and coal have already emerged due to the recent price rallies.
From glut to dearth, the sharp turn of events saw some economists questioning whether policy-driven capacity reductions, despite the short-term miraculous effects, would work in the long run.
Global ratings agency Fitch said in a recent report that China's steel and coal capacity cut targets were tough to hit given the incentive for companies to voluntarily close mines and factories has weakened as prices have recovered and profitability has improved.
The government is well aware of the situation and is committed to allowing the market more say, with the responsibilities of the government and the market more clearly defined.
Wednesday's State Council meeting resulted in an agreement to adopt more methods based on market rules and related laws while phasing out outdated capacities. It also decided to eliminate illegal production facilities and prevent those that have been shutdown from opening again.
Capacity cuts also mean that less taxes are collected by local authorities -- resulting in job losses across the board. Without the intervention of the central authorities, local authorities would be very reluctant to do what is needed, said Feng.
To strike a balance, Feng suggested the market should be responsible for the capacity reductions, while the government should handle the reemployment of redundant workers.
Indeed, the attendees of the State Council meeting stressed that relocating redundant employees was a priority and they would be offered financial support from the government to help them find new employment and guarantee their basic living needs.
In 2016, the central government spent over 30 billion yuan (4.4 billion U.S. dollars) providing aid to 726,000 employees affected by the downsizing of the steel and coal industries.
China plans to assist 500,000 workers made redundant during its capacity cuts in steel and coal sectors this year.
Subsidies will go to employers that re-employ laid-off staff in other posts inside the company, and the government will offer free retraining.
Most important, the key of China's capacity-cuts drive is not simply closure of steel plants or coal mines, but lies in the nurturing of new impetus that will eventually lead to the overall restructuring of Chinese economy, said Dong Ximiao, researcher of Renmin University of China.

China's auto sales drop due to decreased demand, tax hike

Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Both auto production and sales declined in April due to a decrease in demand and higher sales tax, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed Thursday.
A total of 2.08 million vehicles were sold in April, down 2.2 percent year on year, CAAM said, while total output dropped 1.9 percent year on year to 2.14 million.
In the first four months, total output and sales increased by 5.4 percent and 4.6 percent year on year to 9.27 million and 9.09 million vehicles respectively. However, growth slowed from the same period last year.
"Although currently stable, China's auto industry is approaching the critical turning point for a cooling market," said Ye Shengji, deputy secretary general of CAAM.
As the world's largest auto market, China saw auto sales growth hit 26.1 percent in September 2016, the highest point in more than three years, before winding down in the following months.
In October 2015, China slashed the sales tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or below from 10 percent to 5 percent, helping increase total auto sales to a record high of 28.03 million last year.
The tax was raised to 7.5 percent in 2017 and will return to 10 percent again in 2018.
China has had the world's largest car market for eight consecutive years.

China's excavator makers continue to see strong sales

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's excavator manufacturers continued to see strong sales in April, partly due to rising construction demand, according to China Construction Machinery Association.
China's domestic excavator brands and local branches of international brands together sold 14,397 excavators in April, up 101.1 percent year on year, the association said in a report.
The strong growth was mainly driven by domestic demand, while overseas sales rose only 4.2 percent year on year last month.
Over the first four months, total excavator sales rose 99.5 percent compared to same period year on year to 54,864 units, with the market share of Chinese brands at 49.83 percent.
The strong performance came amid the continued stabilization of China's economy and steady growth in fixed-asset investment.
China's economy expanded 6.9 percent in Q1, a strong start for the year, well above the annual target of around 6.5 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Fixed-asset investment rose 9.2 percent in the first three months, higher than the same period year on year, while investment in equipment increased 9.9 percent.
Machinery demand will remain robust in the long term thanks to demand from domestic infrastructure construction and the Belt and Road Initiative will facilitate machinery exports, said Pan Yili, analyst with Shanghai-based Sinolink Securities.
Annual sales of excavators will exceed 100,000 this year, representing a rise of more than 40 percent year on year, the association forecast.

China cuts retail fuel prices

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will cut the retail prices of both gasoline and diesel for the fourth time this year from Friday due to a drop in global oil prices, the country's top economic planner said Thursday.
Gas prices will decrease by 250 yuan (about 36.21 U.S. dollars) per tonne, while the diesel price will be lowered by 235 yuan per tonne, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
China adjusts domestic retail oil prices when international crude prices change by more than 50 yuan per tonne within a 10 working-day period.
International crude oil prices fell in recent weeks as concerns over a global supply glut weighed on the market, and the NDRC price monitoring center said it expects the crude oil oversupply to continue.
The extension of output cuts by major crude producers is likely to raise international oil prices in the short term, but its long-term influence should be limited, said the center, predicting that crude prices will fluctuate.
The NDRC said it is closely monitoring the current pricing mechanism and will continue improvements based on market changes.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between China and African countries surged 16.8 percent year on year in the first quarter (Q1) of 2017 to 38.8 billion U.S. dollars as bilateral economic relations boomed, the commerce ministry said Thursday.
This was the first quarterly rebound in bilateral trade between China and Africa since 2015, with Chinese imports from Africa up 46 percent to 18.4 billion dollars, Sun Jiwen, spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce, told a press conference.
Chinese exports to Africa declined 1 percent year on year to 20.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months of this year, compared with an 18 percent drop in the same period last year, he said.
Sun attributed the growth to the implementation of ten major China-Africa cooperation plans raised at the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2015, which included interest-free loans and preferential policies.
In Q1, Chinese enterprises made more than 750 million U.S. dollars of non-financial direct investment to African countries, up 64 percent year on year, Sun said, adding that the two sides are expected to move towards a higher level of economic cooperation this year.
Bilateral trade between China and Africa stood at 149.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2016.

PHNOM PENH, May 11 (Xinhua) -- President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) Jin Liqun said here on Thursday that infrastructure development is crucial to boost socio-economic development in developing countries.
"We believe that infrastructure is very important for the emerging economies in their efforts to move to the upper middle income countries and improve the livelihood of people," he said at a press conference ahead of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in Phnom Penh.
Jin said the AIIB's mission is to promote broad-based economic and social development through investment in infrastructure.
Jin said ASEAN was the first group of countries which participated in the establishment of the AIIB, and the bank is ready to support connectivity infrastructure development in ASEAN and between ASEAN and other neighboring countries.
"We believe that our efforts to promote the investment in infrastructure and other production sectors will create great opportunities, particularly for the young people in Cambodia and in the region."
Jin reiterated that the establishment of AIIB is not to compete with the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank but to meet the need of capital for infrastructure development in developing countries.
"It is certainly a misconception to think that the establishment of AIIB is to create a rival to the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank," he said. "Currently, the size of Asian economies is much bigger and the demand for infrastructure investment and other private sectors is huge, so it may not be possible for one or two institutions to meet the need in this region."
He said that currently, the cooperation among AIIB, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank is very good.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares drifted into negative territory for most of the day but managed to recoup most of the losses by the end of the trading day, lifted by strong heavyweight performance.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index increased 0.29 percent to end the day at 3,061.5 points, and the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.2 percent higher at 9,776.45 points.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, ended 0.06 percent higher to close at 1,772.41 points.
Market sentiment remained fragile as regulatory measures on the financial sector continued to intensify.
Shares related to Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, drove the rebound Thursday. Six firms, including Tianjin Motimo Membrane Technology and Capital Environmental Protection Co., surged by the daily limit of 10 percent.
China announced plans last month to create Xiongan New Area, which authorities described as a "major historic and strategic choice" that would be "crucial for the millennium to come," sparking investors' enthusiasm over related stocks.
Shares related to Belt and Road Initiative were also strong ahead of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on May 14-15. Jiangsu Lianyungang Port jumped 10 percent to end the day at 8.21 yuan (1.19 U.S. dollars).

NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- With arms wide open, Sugreev Singh was pouring tea back and forth between two pots. The brownish milky fluid drew a smooth arch in the air as it ran from one pot to the other.
Singh, a "chai wala" or tea seller, was performing alone in a stall in New Deli, capital of India. Business was good, but he rarely had to stop to collect money. Most customers just scanned a code on the stall and transferred money with their mobile phones.
Less than a year ago, Singh, like most Indians, knew nothing about mobile payment.
What is less known is that India's leapfrog from cash to mobile payment, skipping debit and credit cards, was made possible through cooperation with China's e-commerce giant Alibaba.
Now more than 200 million Indians, most of whom don't even have a bank account, are paying with their mobile phones.
COPY FROM CHINA
In early 2016, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Indian e-commerce company PayTM, or Pay Through Mobile, had an eye-opening trip to China.
Strolling on the streets of Hangzhou, east China, Sharma was surprised to see QR codes everywhere. A QR code is a cryptic matrix of barcodes that contain scannable information.
Sharma saw almost every shop, vendor or parlor had a QR code printed on a slip of paper. People, many of whom walk around without any cash or credit card, are so used to paying by scanning the code with a mobile phone.
At the moment, PayTM hit a bottleneck in rolling out digital payment in India as they had to provide business owners with costly machines to collect money. Sharma and his engineers had never thought that a code on a piece of paper could do the trick.
Sharma then copied this business mode to India with the help of PayTM's business partner Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba, whose Alipay is one of the most popular mobile wallets in China.
Sharma wouldn't have expected that the cooperation put him in the best place to benefit most from India's upcoming financial reform.
In November, the Indian government decided to scrap 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes, removing four-fifths of the country's paper money. The move was designed to curb corruption. But it had the side effect of catapulting India's transition to digital payment, such as mobile wallets.
"We happened to have the technology, the talents and the money" when the policy came out, Sharma said. The number of PayTM's users exploded, ranking it as the top mobile wallet in India and among the top four in the world.
As more Chinese high-tech companies become globally known and respected, they are gaining followers throughout the world, especially in developing countries who import their business modes and technologies to copy their success in local markets.
Before, some say China copy from Silicon. Now Silicon is learning from China, especially Chinese mobile Internet technologies, Sharma said.
ONLINE SILK ROAD
In the 13th century, Marco Polo was impressed by the use of paper money in China and brought the idea to Europe. More than 700 years later, Sharma was amazed by the extensive use of mobile wallet in China and copied the business to India.
The mobile wallet Sharma brought back cushioned the impact of India's cash ban on the economy. More importantly, it provided much needed financial service to millions of Indian people. India has 1.3 billion people but only 24.51 million credit cards and 661.8 million debit cards.
Insufficient financial service is not a problem unique to India but a common issue in developing countries.
Ant Financial is trying to bring their success in India to other developing countries. It has reached agreement on cooperation with leading digital payment companies in Thailand and the Philippines.
By promoting digital payment, Ant Financial is paving way for an online silk road where people can easily order and pay for products and services from not only the local market but also other parts of the world, said Jia Hang, a director of Ant Financial's international branch.
The driving force of Ant Financial's operation overseas is its leading technologies. The company aims at bringing cutting-edge digital payment technologies to India, Thailand, the Philippines and other countries, CEO of Ant Financial Jing Xiandong said.
In the past few years, China has emerged as the world's largest e-commerce market with annual transactions amounting to more than 20 trillion yuan (2.9 trillion U.S. dollars). The sheer scale and unprecedented comple
ty of transactions forced Chinese digital payment companies to innovate and improve at a breathtaking pace.
As a result, Chinese companies developed some of the most reliable technologies in risk control, cheat-proof and anti-money laundering systems for digital payment, saving years of research and development for local partners, Jia said.

China questions U.S. trade investigations into steel imports

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) Thursday questioned U.S. trade investigations into imports of steel products from six countries including China, describing the measures as "excessive."
The U.S. Department of Commerce has decided to initiate anti-dumping investigations against cold-drawn steel mechanical tubing from China, Germany, India, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. Products from China and India will also be subject to anti-subsidy investigations.
On the MOC website, Wang Hejun, head of the trade remedy and investigation bureau, responded to the decision and expressed concerns over rising protectionism from the world's largest economy.
The frequent trade remedies and restrictive measures have attracted the attention of the World Trade Organization, Wang said.
"Under excessive protective policies, U.S. steel plants lack the motivation to make adjustments and are losing their global competitiveness. Trade partners will be harmed, and problems in the U.S. steel sector will still remain," Wang said.
The United States should handle the case in a cautious and fair manner and create a stable and predictable environment for international cooperation in the steel sector, he said.
In the face of overcapacity, the Chinese government has continued to downsized glutted steel and coal sectors.
China has phased out 31.7 million tonnes of steel capacity and 68.97 million tonnes of coal capacity to date, about 63.4 percent and 46 percent of the annual targets respectively, according to a statement following a State Council executive meeting on Wednesday.

HANGZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Construction of Boeing's first overseas facility as part of its 737 production system started Thursday in the east China port city of Zhoushan.
The construction will consist of two parts -- a Boeing 737 completion center and the delivery center. It is scheduled to be completed in 2018.
Boeing and Chinese aviation manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd.(COMAC) will jointly run the completion center, in which flight entertainment systems and seats will be installed in Boeing's 737 aircraft.
"Today we all see a vibrant, win-win partnership that supports the growth and development of China's aviation industry and the economy, as well as the U.S. economy," said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
The completion center also provides services such as coating, repairs and maintenance of Boeing aircraft.
The 737 delivery center is solely owned by Boeing.
Boeing and COMAC signed an agreement in October 2016 to set up the plant in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, 287 km southeast of Shanghai. The plant is designed to deliver 100 Boeing 737 planes per year.
Conner said Boeing supplies 150-200 of "the world's most innovative and fuel-efficient airplanes" to Chinese customers a year, accounting for a quarter of Boeing's global delivery. One third of the jets are Boeing 737s.
"The completion and delivery centers will bring 737 MAX closer to Chinese customers, who will take delivery right here in China," he said.
He added that Chinese companies play a manufacturing role in "every Boeing airplane produced today and on more than 9,000 airplanes flying around the world."
The 40-hectare plant is designed to include hangars, office buildings, warehouses, tarmac and runways.
Lin Nianxiu, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, attended the ground-breaking ceremony calling the Zhoushan plant "a model for Sino-America high-tech cooperation."
Zhoushan is an archipelago and island city which has the largest fisheries in China and boasts strong shipbuilding, tourism and service industries.
To accommodate aircraft manufacturing, the city's Putuoshan Airport is undergoing a 750 million yuan (108 million U.S. dollars) expansion to become an international airport.
In addition to supporting Boeing, the Zhujiajian aviation industry park in Zhoushan will also develop an entire industrial chain for aircraft manufacturing, with the capacity to assemble, deliver and modify 600 aircraft per year by 2025.
On Thursday, Conner also congratulated COMAC for the successful first flight of its C919, calling it "an important moment in aviation history." Boeing began partnering with COMAC on projects in 2012.



Risks on Belt & Road loans controllable: bank officials

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese loans to countries and regions along the Belt and Road will not add to local debt burden, while risks rising from such loans are under control, bank officials said Thursday.
Ding Xiangqun, vice president of China Development Bank (CDB), said at a press conference that the majority of projects supported by the CDB generated sufficient cash flow to pay back the principle and interest.
"It's quite biased to say that our loans add to local debt burden as we choose the projects very carefully, making sure they have economic value," said Ding.
She added that the bank also had strict credit requirements for sovereign loans, making sure the terms on these loans are in line with those required by the International Monetary Fund.
Sun Ping, vice president of the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank), said the bank has established risk-control mechanisms to evaluate the feasibility of loans based on the upper limit of debt that each country could bear, and widespread defaults on sovereign debts are unlikely.
"With strict measures to mitigate risks, I'm confident that the level of non-performing loans will remain under control," said Sun.
Since the launch of the Belt of Road Initiative in 2013, China Exim Bank has supported more than 1,200 projects related to the initiative, with contracted value surpassing 700 billion yuan (about 101.4 billion U.S. dollars).
By the end of 2016, CDB had given than 160 billion U.S. dollars of loans to countries along the Belt and Road to support development in industries such as infrastructure and energy resources, according to Ding.


Chinese OTA giant Ctrip reports strong Q1 financial performance

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ctrip.com, China's largest online travel agency, beat financial performance expectations in the first quarter of this year thanks to expansion efforts both home and abroad.
The NASDAQ-listed company saw net revenue of 6.1 billion yuan (8.84 million U.S. dollars) in Q1, an increase of 46 percent year on year and rising 20 percent compared with Q4 2016, according to its financial statement.
Transportation tickets were the biggest contributor to revenue, growing by 48 percent year on year to 2.9 billion yuan in Q1, which was partly attributed to the company's acquisition of Skyscanner, a leading European airfare comparison website, last year.
"By leveraging Skycanner and other strategic overseas investments, we expect to further strengthen our international product offerings and improve user experiences for both Chinese and international travelers," said James Liang, executive chairman of Ctrip.
Accommodation and package tours helped Ctrip generate 2.1 billion yuan and 702 million yuan, respectively.
The income from operations in Q1 was 414 million yuan, compared with loss of 1.8-billion-yuan in the same period in 2016.
"We kicked off 2017 with great results with continuous healthy revenue growth and margin expansion. We have also been making great strides in penetrating into lower-tier cities and expanding internationally," said Jane Sun, Ctrip CEO.
Ctrip expects net revenue growth in Q2 to continue at a year-on-year rate of about 40 percent to 45 percent, the statement added.

China's taste for Aussie beef a blessing for industry

by Matt Walsh
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A continually growing demand for Australian cattle from China is likely to make the industry going from strength to strength, according to experts who are lauding China's taste for Aussie beef.
Following news that Australia's richest woman and mining magnate Gina Rinehart was seeking to ramp up cattle exports to China, industry experts have said that Australia's beef industry was likely to see a robust growth.
Michael Whitehead from the ANZ Bank's agribusiness sector overnight told News Corp that it is was no wonder Australia's richest were continuing to pour their money into the beef industry, citing Rinehart and retail giant Gerry Harvey as examples of prime beef investors.
"Being in control of the start of the beef supply chain is a great place to be if protein is going to be increasingly in short supply," Whitehead said of Australia's beef industry.
"Investors, too, are starting to look for industries that can't be disrupted. You can disrupt banks, hotels, media, taxis and property, but how do you disrupt Australian beef?"
"So it follows that if you are a billionaire, it is obvious that you will never lose your money by buying and investing in Australian cattle properties. It's a great project and space to be in."
Harold Mitchell, a prominent Australian beef investor, told News Corp that unlike the mining boom, after which demand for resources dropped, it was highly unlikely that a demand for basic proteins such as beef would subside, instead predicting that demand would continue to rise for decades to come, even if prices come down when supply catches up with demand.
"I've been a great supporter of the industry and still think it has a long way to go. There will always be a shortage of protein in a growing world," he said.
"The China trade is just starting to take off and the U.S. has had so much demand for our hamburger meat; but things are changing fast and we are right at a point where the price of stock is so high that I fear a (price) collapse is coming."
He said if Australian suppliers could breed more beef cattle, Australia would be able to meet the demands for both local and overseas consumers for decades in the future.

China becomes second source of Asian tourists for Peru

Editor: An
LIMA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China has become the second source of Asian tourists going to Peru, said the Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, Eduardo Ferreyros, on Wednesday.
In a press conference about Peru's tourism plans, the minister said that China now stood only behind Japan, which is in first place for Asian tourists. He added that trends showed Asian tourists will increasingly enter Peru in the future.
For Ferreyros, the increase in Chinese tourists is due to intense campaigns that Peruvian authorities have been carrying out in certain Chinese cities to attract more visitors.
Another cause for the rise in Chinese tourists, he said was that Peru had eliminated visa requirements for Chinese citizens who already possess visas for the U.S., the Schengen Zone, the U.K. or Australia.
According to Ferreyros, the government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has been working hard to drive Chinese tourism in Peru and to make it a permanent fixture in the Asian country.
He said that, as a result of this, Peru was named "Best Tourism Destination in the Americas" at the Shanghai World Travel Fair -SWTF 2017 in April.
According to official Tourism Ministry projections, Peru will receive around 35,000 Chinese tourists in 2017.

Consumers select vegetables at a supermarket in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, March 9, 2017. China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, advanced 0.8 percent year on year in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Thursday. It was well below market expectation of 1.7 percent, and substantially lower than the growth of 2.5 percent in January. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Xiong Qi)
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's inflation held steady in April, reinforcing views about stabilization in the economy and giving policy makers more leeway to tighten regulation.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.2 percent year on year in April, against 0.9 in March, as higher non-food prices outweighed continued declines in food prices, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Wednesday.
The growth remains below the government's annual target of around 3 percent set for 2017.
Producer price index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 6.4 percent year on year in April, down from 7.6 percent in March. On a monthly basis, the PPI fell 0.4 percent, the first month-on-month decline since July last year.
Falling commodity prices are the main drag on gains in PPI, but reasonable demand, further moves against excess capacity and a weaker yuan, prevent a sharper slide, Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik said.
Orlik expects CPI to rise in the months ahead, but not high enough to shift the central bank off its cautious, incrementally tightening path.
Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities, said the mild CPI growth and PPI's pull-back in April will give policy makers more scope to contain debt and financial risk.
With the economy doing reasonably well, policy has shifted to deleveraging and risk control, but Deng warned that over-tightening could destabilizing growth.
As part of the effort, China has shifted away from a relatively loose monetary policy that helped lift growth over the past years, gradually guided interbank lending rates higher and tightened supervision on non-performing assets, shadow banking and local government financing.
These measures might be positive for the long-term health of the financial system and the economy but may lead to weaker fixed asset investment and economic activity, UBS economist Wang Tao said.
Concern over the regulatory squeeze has weighed on the stock markets, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shedding more than 6 percent during the past month.
Ren Zeping, chief economist at Founder Securities, said while the regulatory squeeze will continue in the short term,the government must balance the frequency and intensity of policies to deleverage, manage liquidity and stabilize growth.
China's GDP grew 6.9 percent in the Q1.

SANYA, Hainan, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sanya, a popular tourist destination in south China's island province of Hainan, announced measures Wednesday to restrict non-locals from buying new homes to cool the property market.
Those who do not have permanent residence permits in Hainan will be prohibited from buying new apartments in Sanya, if they already own at least one home in the province, according to the new rule.
If they want to buy a house in the city proper and parts of its coastal areas, they must provide personal income tax or social security records for at least a year in Hainan.
In addition, buyers of unfinished apartments in the city will be prohibited from reselling them. New finished homes purchased by non-locals are allowed to be resold only two years after they obtain the ownership certificate, and the restriction is also subject to second or more apartments owned by locals.
The measures came as home buyers across the country have flocked to Sanya, which features warm tropical climate and clean air. In March, house prices in Sanya grew 2.3 percent month-on-month.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's trade with Belt and Road countries reached about 20 trillion yuan (2.9 trillion U.S. dollars) during 2014-2016, an official said Wednesday.
"The growth is faster than the global average," said Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming at a press conference in Beijing.
China has jointly set up 56 overseas economic cooperation zones in 20 Belt and Road countries, covering processing and manufacturing, resource utilization, agriculture, commercial logistics and R&D.
The country has 11 free trade zones (FTZs) in Belt and Road countries, accounting for half of its FTZs with foreign countries, according to Qian.
China will host the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on May 14-15.
More than 1,500 delegates, including officials, academics, entrepreneurs, representatives of financial institutions and media organizations from 130 nations, as well as representatives from more than 70 international organizations, will attend.
The Belt and Road Initiative aims to expand links between Asia, Africa and Europe through billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese commercial lenders brought in more profits in the first quarter of this year, while the quality of their assets remained stable, China's top banking regulator said Wednesday.
Net profits of all Chinese lenders stood at 493.3 billion yuan (71.4 billion U.S. dollars) in Q1, representing growth of 4.61 percent year on year, said China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
However, the pace was slower than the 14.3-percent growth year on year in total assets of Chinese banks which reached 238.5 trillion yuan, showing the profitability of commercial lenders was waning.
Chinese lenders' bad loan ratio remained almost flat at 1.74 percent at the end of March 2017, said CBRC.
The banks' loan loss provisions, funds set aside to cover potential loan losses, reached 2.82 trillion yuan, 156 billion yuan higher than the end of 2016.
The average capital adequacy ratio, the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets, stood at 13.26 percent.

Commentary: China no wonderland for speculators

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- As Chinese authorities increase safeguards on financial security, some grumble about ripples from the tightened regulations. But it's time for speculators to stop dreaming of a wonderland in China.
The ongoing tightening campaign addresses longer-term challenges rather than alleviating immediate needs of China's economy. Investors should adapt to these circumstances and prepare for long-term interests.
Worldwide, supervision and regulation are at the center of financial market stability. Supervision of systemically important institutions and infrastructure is vital to rational and effective risk prevention and control.
After years of reforms, China has become a well-established global financial power at a difficult time for a world economy beset by risks and challenges.
If the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 international financial crisis are anything to go by, the next cataclysm will come as a result of inadequate risk prevention, swiftly followed by a universal economic collapse and social woes.
Along with rapid growth in recent years, China's financial sector has been exposed to various risks -- such as piling debts and illegal fund-raising -- that imperil financial market stability and could hinder economic transformation and structural upgrading.
Having anticipated potential threats, Chinese leadership pinpointed financial security is vital to national security and a key foundation for stable and healthy development.
With a strong supervisory storm sweeping the country's financial sector, regulators have shown their resolve to control chaos and prevent risks as well as give the real economy excellent financial support.
The campaign has started to show results. Official data showed that the debt to assets ratio of enterprises with annual turnover of over 20 million yuan (about 2.9 million U.S. dollars) dropped 0.6 percentage points year on year at the end of February.
Thanks to an improving interplay between finance and the real economy, China's economic restructuring -- driven by supply-side structural reforms, innovation and entrepreneurship -- is beginning to bear fruit.
Consumption and service sectors have become new benchmarks of the Chinese economy. The service sector leaves agriculture and the secondary industry far behind in terms of growth.
A healthier Chinese economy will never be reduced to a wonderland for speculators. Investors need a broad vision and long-term view to share prosperity arising from China's growth.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares returned to losses Wednesday following a short-lived rebound the previous trading day as toughened financial supervision continued to drain liquidity and investors chose caution.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index (SCI) went down 0.9 percent to end the day at 3,052.78 points. The smaller Shenzhen Component Index shed 1.3 percent at 9,756.81 points.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, declined 1.73 percent to close at 1,771.32 points.
Some 2,500 stocks across the two bourses dropped, in contrast with around 400 stocks that saw gains. Plane manufacturers, companies in environmental protection, and cement producers led the declines. Avic Aircraft lost 7.29 percent to 17.8 yuan (2.58 U.S. dollars).
Bucking the trend, heavyweights in banking and insurance sectors played a major role in propping up indices. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the country's largest lender by market value, climbed 0.62 percent to 4.9 yuan.
Analysts believe the market is still in the middle of adjustments as improved regulatory measures continued to weigh on investors' sentiment. The SCI had slipped for five-straight days before posting slight growth Tuesday.
Trading remained thin at slightly higher than 400 billion yuan on Wednesday.
Before heading south in the afternoon, shares were at one point lifted moderately by resilient new economic indicators.
China's consumer inflation accelerated in April as the consumer price index grew 1.2 percent year on year, outpacing market estimates, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Growth of the producer price index retreated to 6.4 percent.

China's consumer inflation up 1.2 pct, beating estimates

Editor: An
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Growth of China's consumer inflation accelerated in April, as higher non-food prices outweighed continued decline in food prices, official data showed Wednesday.
Consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 1.2 percent year on year in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), outpacing market estimates of 1.1 percent.
The growth quickened from March's 0.9 percent expansion and February's 0.8 percent. On a monthly basis, the CPI climbed 0.1 percent.
NBS attributed the pick-up in CPI to higher non-food prices, which grew 2.4 percent year on year in April and rose 0.2 percent over March.
Two national holidays in April had driven up prices for air tickets, hotels and travel services, contributing to the accelerating CPI increase, NBS senior statistician Sheng Guoqing said.
Food prices declined 3.5 percent as vegetable prices fell 21.6 percent from a year earlier on ample supplies. The costs of pork and eggs dropped 8.1 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent in April from a year ago, almost on par with the last reading.
Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik expected the CPI growth to rise in the months ahead, but not high enough to shift the central bank off its cautious, incremental tightening path.
CPI increased 1.4 percent in the first four months of the year. The government aims to keep consumer inflation at around 3 percent this year.
The producer price index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 6.4 percent year on year in April, down from 7.6 percent in March and missing expectations of 6.7 percent.
Slumping commodity prices are the main driver of smaller gains in the PPI, but robust demand, efforts to close excess capacity and a weaker yuan, which increases import prices, will prevent a sharper slide in factory-gate inflation, Orlik said.
On a monthly basis, the PPI fell 0.4 percent, the first month-on-month decline since July.
Lian Ping, chief economist at Bank of Communications, said the PPI increase may continue to ease over the rest of 2017 with February being the peak of the year.
The steady price data reinforced views about stabilization in the world's second-largest economy. China's GDP grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter of the year, up from 6.8 percent in the last quarter of 2016 and official target of around 6.5 percent set for the year.
Chinese stocks edged up after the release of the data. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 0.26 percent to end the morning session at 3,088.63 points.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's producer price inflation continued to ease in April as retreating commodity prices pushed factory-gate costs lower, official data showed Wednesday.
The producer price index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 6.4 percent year on year last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The pace retreated from the 7.6 percent growth registered in March and 7.8 percent in February, which marked the highest since 2008.
Month on Month, the PPI edged down 0.4 percent, the first monthly drop since July last year.
Price declines widened in major industries in April, with factory-gate prices in the oil and gas extraction industry down 4.2 percent from a month earlier, noted NBS senior statistician Sheng Guoqing.
China's PPI has stayed in positive territory since September, when it ended a four-year streak of declines, partly due to the government's successful campaign to cut industrial overcapacity, which benefited the wider economy.
While the inflation is cooling in recent months, a slide back into deflation is not expected as robust demand, efforts to close excess capacity, and a weaker yuan are all preventing a sharper slide in the index, noted Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg.
But the deceleration in prices will reduce benefits to the broader economy such as increasing corporate profits, he added.
The PPI figures came alongside the release of the consumer price index, which rose 1.2 percent in April.

China central bank injects liquidity into market via reverse repos, PSL

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The central bank injected cash into the money market through a variety of tools Wednesday to ease liquidity.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 110 billion yuan (about 15.93 billion U.S. dollars) of reverse repos, a process by which central banks purchase securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
The operations included 90 billion yuan of seven-day reverse repo priced to yield 2.45 percent; 10 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent; and 10 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
It was the first cash injection by the PBOC via reverse repos after a three-business day suspension.
As 190 billion yuan of previous reverse repos were due Wednesday, the operation still resulted in a net liquidity withdraw of 80 billion yuan from the market.
On Wednesday, the PBOC also pumped 47.6 billion yuan into the market through pledged supplementary lending (PSL), a tool designed to help the central bank better target longer-term lending rates.
The central bank has increasingly relied on open-market operations for liquidity, rather than cuts to interest rates or reserve requirement ratios to maintain its prudent monetary policy.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a national venture capital fund for guiding the development of startup companies in new sectors of strategic importance.
The fund was set up by the Ministry of Finance, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Development & Investment Corporation (SDIC), among others.
SDIC Chairman Wang Huisheng said that the fund had raised a total of 17.8 billion yuan (about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars), with 80 percent to be invested in startups in initial and early stages and 20 percent in mature enterprises that are not yet listed.
The State Council, China's cabinet, decided to set up the venture capital fund in early 2015. In July 2016, SDIC set up a company as the management platform for the fund.
The fund will promote the development of new strategic sectors, including new information technology, energy conservation and environmental protection, new materials and high-end equipment manufacturing.

Internationalization of Chinese yuan to boost Kenya's economy

Editor: Mengjie
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The internationalization of the Chinese yuan will help boost Kenya's economy due to the close Sino-Kenya commercial and trade ties, the bankers lobby said on Tuesday.
Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) Chairman Lamin Manjang told Xinhua in Nairobi that Beijing is now one of Kenya's top trading partners and this has raised the significance of the renminbi (RMB).
"So, if the yuan is easily convertible to the Kenya shilling, it will ease trade between Kenya and China and hence boost Kenya's economy," Manjang said on the sidelines of the Euromoney Kenya conference.
The day long seminar brought over 200 participants including government officials, policymakers, bankers, investors, and entrepreneurs to deliberate on the economic environment in Africa.
Kenyan banks are increasingly promoting the use of the RMB as a currency of international trade as China is a major player in global trade.
Manjang said that the use of the Chinese currency minimizes currency risk of traders by eliminating the need to covert the Kenya shilling to U.S. dollars and then to yuan.
According to KBA, the number of banks that can provide Chinese yuan over the counter is increasing.
"Typically, banks that that are strong in China and Africa have an advantage over the smaller banks when it comes to embracing the renminbi," he added.
Manjang, who is also the CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Kenya, said that his bank has fully embraced the RMB.
"We are now able to help clients who want to settle obligations in China by converting Kenya shilling to yuan," he said.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of "Chinese Brands Day" will help independent brands, a senior official said Tuesday.
The State Council, China's cabinet, has approved a Chinese Brands Day, to be held on May 10 each year from this year. The first falls on Wednesday.
Influential brands are symbols of the overall competitiveness of companies and countries, and can help lead economic transition, according to Wang Dong, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planner.
Compared with developed countries, China is still short of globally influential brands but well equipped to accelerate brand development, Wang added.
Chinese Brands Day will publicize brands owned independently by Chinese companies, tell the stories of the brands and raise brand recognition, according to Wang.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance regulator said Tuesday it will find and defuse hidden risks in the use of insurance funds, a fresh move to tighten supervision of the multi-trillion dollar sector.
Authorities will stop the illegal use of insurance funds, keep the leverage ratio under control and fill regulatory gaps, according to a statement from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
Inspections will be focused on major investment in stocks, equities, real estate, alternative and financial products as well as overseas investment.
The sector will be screened for compliance risks, regulatory arbitrage, asset-liability mismatches and other major risks.
Those who violate laws and regulations will receive the maximum punishment.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market late last year.
Tuesday's move came two days after the CIRC called for a strict and effective supervision framework, pointing out that regulatory loopholes had given rise to risky practices.
It was also part of the deleveraging of China's economy to ward off financial risks after years of a relatively eased monetary stance.
In Tuesday's statement, the CIRC said insurance funds should serve the real economy and help supply-side structural reform.
By the end of December, the combined assets of China's insurance sector totalled 15.12 trillion yuan (2.2 trillion U.S. dollars), official data showed.

China financial institutions see overseas investment outflow in Q1

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas direct investment into China's financial institutions, including banks, insurers and securities firms, saw a net outflow of 1.29 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 2017, the nation's foreign exchange regulator revealed Tuesday.
This is an increase from a net outflow of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2016, equivalent to roughly half of the net outflow of overseas investment into the industry registered for the whole of 2016, according to data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
In the first three months, the country's financial institutions made net outbound investment of 1.98 billion U.S. dollars in overseas companies, lower than the quarterly average level recorded in 2016, according to the SAFE.
Last year, China's financial institutions' net outbound investment totaled 9.65 billion U.S. dollars in overseas companies, official data showed.
SAFE has released data on a quarterly basis since 2012, as part of the regulator's efforts to increase the transparency of foreign exchange statistics.
Overseas investment to financial organs makes up only a small portion of overall foreign direct investment into China.
Earlier official data showed foreign direct investment to the Chinese mainland, excluding the financial institutions, maintained steady growth last year on the back of strong investment in the service industry.
Foreign direct investment rose 4.1 percent year on year to reach 813 billion yuan (around 118 billion U.S. dollars) in 2016.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Local governments have issued less debt this year following measures to ease the country's mounting debt burden, data showed Tuesday.
In the first four months of 2017, local governments raised 799.4 billion yuan (116 billion U.S. dollars) through 178 instances of debt issuance, down from the 2.02 trillion yuan raised in 296 issuances a year ago, according to data compiled by Wind, a financial information provider.
China's authorities have stepped up efforts to rein in financial risks, promising to correct irregular fundraising behavior by local governments.
In a statement released last week, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) asked provincial authorities to examine their financing practices and rectify all irregularities by the end of July. Progress will be tracked by MOF supervisors.
The measures taken to standardize the financing channels of local governments will help to expose hidden debt, and a clear boundary between local governments and their financing vehicles will improve China's bond yield curve, making it more market-oriented, said Zheng Lianghai, an analyst with Dongxing Securities.
With continued government action against high leverage, the growth of local debt issuance will likely slow further, analysts predicted.

Economic Watch: China toughens auditing of overseas investment by state-owned companies
Source: Xinhua
2017-05-09 13:38:16
Editor: ying
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities will introduce an improved, rigorous system of auditing overseas investment by state-owned companies as the pressure of cross-border capital flow remains.
The auditing system focuses on decision-making by state-owned companies on overseas investment and joint ventures, and their financial management and internal control, in addition to capital security, operating benefits and risk control of overseas state-owned assets.
Major methods of auditing include domestic inspection, auditing and analysis of documents and inquiries into relevant parties.
If necessary, regulators will go overseas for on-site verification and evidence collection in accordance with international practices and laws of the countries in which state-owned companies invest.
Outbound investment has grown rapidly in recent years and played an important role in deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between China and other countries as well as promoting domestic economic restructuring.
However, irrational speculation, illegal transfer of assets, and fake transactions all disrupt China's foreign exchange and financial markets, causing state-owned asset losses and hurting national interests.
A recent report released by China's foreign exchange regulator unveiled some cases in which companies had illegally transferred assets overseas under the guise of outbound investment.
Some newly established firms, which had produced nothing, were providing large sums of outbound investment. Some heavily indebted companies borrowed more to acquire companies overseas. These are just a few of the examples listed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
Risks are inherent in any investment and cannot be avoided. Given growth in overseas state-owned assets, regulation of those assets has been a new challenge facing Chinese authorities.
In support of the country's "going out" strategy for investment, businesses of state-owned companies, especially centrally administered ones, have expanded to more than 150 countries and regions with over five trillion yuan (about 725 billion U.S. dollars) in overseas assets, earning global fame for high-speed train, nuclear power and ultra high voltage projects.
Compared to foreign multinational giants, Chinese state-owned companies lack experience in overseas operations and risk control.
With more companies "going out," China's overseas investment has been exposed to complicated problems in culture, human resources and corporate management. Some enterprises have paid high prices for those problems.
"The first step is to roll out measures to regulate overseas investment, the second is to stipulate company operations strictly, and the third is to develop a system of accountability," said Xiao Yaqing, head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Noting an irrational tendency in outbound investment, Chinese authorities have set stricter rules and advised companies to make their investment decisions more carefully.
Since the beginning of 2017, SASAC has introduced negative lists and designated investment redlines for both domestic and overseas investment by state-owned companies.
"There is no doubt that a more comprehensive and stringent auditing system will help standardize China's overseas investment and contribute to maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets," said Li Jin, chief researcher with the China Enterprise Research Institute.
China's outbound direct investment fell by 64 percent year on year to reach 20.9 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, thanks to increasingly rational market players and guidance by relevant government departments.
Last year, the country's outbound direct investment surged over 40 percent from a year earlier, the result of an increasingly globalized Chinese economy and also stemming from some irrational or illegal acts.

SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's 120-year-oldspider bike manufacturer Phoenix is to supply bike-sharing startup Ofo and help it explore overseas markets.
In the following year, Ofo will buy at least 5 million bikes from Shanghai-based Phoenix and put them on the streets of Beijing, Shanghai and neighboring areas, the manufacturer announced Monday at a ceremony celebrating its 120th anniversary.
In addition, Phoenix plans to produce various versions of bikes for Ofo based on overseas demand.
All the Phoenix-made bikes for Ofo will bear the Phoenix trademark.
Phoenix bikes have been sold in more than 90 countries and regions, with overseas sales accounting for 40 percent of the brand's total.
The two companies will also set up a research and development center and a quality management center to serve the eastern China market.
The bike-sharing business, which took off in big Chinese cities less than two years ago, allows riders to hire bikes for as little as one yuan (about 15 U.S. cents) per hour via a mobile app and drop them off anywhere for the next user.
There were 18.9 million users of shared bicycles nationwide in 2016. The number is expected to hit 50 million by the end of 2017.

Chinese banking regulator tightens collateral management

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top banking regulator has told commercial banks to strengthen management over loan collateral to contain financial risks.
Aware of some management irregularities in some commercial banks, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) made specific demands concerning classification, evaluation and collateral rate determination in a guideline released Monday.
Commercial banks should make detailed categorization of collateral, while the catalogue of acceptable collaterals should be updated at least once a year, according to the CBRC.
The regulator also ordered banks to revalue collateral at least once a year, and the ceiling of collateral rates should be adjusted in accordance with business cycles, risk profiles and market condition.
Zeng Gang, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said better management of quality and authenticity of collateral would help reduce losses and boost banks' ability to handle bad assets.
In addition, the CBRC asked commercial banks to maintain a balance between collateral loans and credit loans to provide better financial services to small and micro enterprises.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Risks facing China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) investing in the Belt and Road (B&R) region are generally controllable, a senior official said Monday.
Both domestic and international investments face risks and SOEs continue to make progress in overseas expansion by learning from previous mistakes, said Xiao Yaqing, head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Over the last three years, 47 Chinese SOEs supervised by the SASAC have taken part in 1,676 projects in countries and regions along the B&R spanning energy, infrastructure and industrial cooperation.
To reduce risks, SASAC and SOEs have taken many steps to improve analysis, prevention and removal of risks, Xiao said, adding that they look forward to more cooperation with international companies and organizations.
Investment in the B&R region is coordinated. SOEs have their own plans and are increasing supervision of the decision-making process for overseas projects by including more stakeholders, he said.
Those violating regulations and causing losses through indiscriminate investment will be held accountable, he added.


China Exclusive: China's Transsion phones find success in Africa

Editor: huaxia
SHENZHEN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Few Chinese have heard of Transsion, a Chinese phone maker based in Shenzhen, but the brand has millions of users in Africa, making it one of the most successful on the continent.
Transsion has more than 100 million users in Africa. Its factories have a total production capacity of 300,000 phones per day, said Arif Chowdhury, vice president of Transsion Holdings, which was founded in 2006.
"A decade ago, the sales were less than one million, mainly in India and Bangladesh. Transsion became successful only when it put almost all of its attention on the African market," said Chowdhury, who is from Bangladesh.
In 2016, Transsion produced 79.91 million phones, about 80 times the volume ten years ago.
According to technology consultant firm Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Transsion's market share in 2016 was about 40 percent in Africa, beating bigger competitors such as Samsung and Huawei
"Transsion in Africa is like what Nokia was in China years ago. Many people favor it over other phones," said Chowdhury.
"For a company to succeed, we need to find out what exactly people want. African users like selfies, multiple phone card slots, enabling local language, stable music function and longer battery life," he said.
The company organized 200 technicians to improve camera function and calibrate the exposure to suit darker skin tones.
"We have dual-card, triple and even four-card phones, because there are many phone operators in Africa, and it is expensive to dial between networks," said Chowdhury.
Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of Mobile Phone China Association, said Transsion's success is rooted in its dedication to a highly segmented market.
"Many of the Chinese phone makers have explored foreign markets, but many have also failed because they did not work on the brand," Wang said.
Wang said Transsion has had big success selling cheap phones.
"If they want to continue to win, they must work on technology and produce more smart phones," he said. Enditem

China Focus: State firms seek opportunities under B&R initiative

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mombasa-Nairobi railway in Kenya will begin trial operations this month after the project started two and a half years ago, which used Chinese expertise and technology.
The 480-km railway is the first phase of a line that will eventually connect Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan, and is a key infrastructure project under the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative.
It is expected to lower freight transportation costs by 40 percent, as well as create jobs and drive economic growth in Kenya. The Chinese company in charge directly employed over 37,000 locals during the construction project.
"We saw huge potential in the B&R when it was first proposed in 2013," said Liu Qitao, chairman of China Communications Construction Co. (CCCC), whose subsidiary corporation is in charge of the railway project.
Companies under CCCC have built some 10,320 km of highways, 95 deep-water wharves, 10 airports, 152 bridges and 2,080 km of railways in B&R countries, Liu said at a press conference Monday.
The company's international projects reflect the enthusiasm of Chinese state firms for opportunities under the B&R -- a trade and infrastructure network that aims to connect Asia with Europe and Africa.
Over the last three years, 47 centrally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have taken part in 1,676 projects in countries and regions along the B&R spanning energy, infrastructure and industrial cooperation, according to Xiao Yaqing, head of State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Oil giant PetroChina has undertaken cooperation on 50 projects in 19 countries, facilitating more efficient oil supply and market networks, according to company president Wang Dongjin.
China's SOEs now have 9,112 agencies across 185 countries and regions.
While local economies have benefited from B&R projects, Chinese businesses have enriched their overseas expansion experience in areas such as management and personnel training.
In the process, Chinese companies have played an important role in driving globalization and contributing to global economic recovery through pushing for freer trade and cultural exchanges, Xiao noted.
The SASAC will continue to push SOEs to participate in major construction projects as part of the initiative to make greater contributions to the sustainable development of the world economy, Xiao said.
Earlier official data showed China had signed 126 billion U.S. dollars worth of new contracts for projects in countries along the Belt and Road in 2016, up 36 percent year on year.
In the context of weak global growth and sluggish investment and trade, the initiative has won extensive support. More than 40 countries and international organizations have already signed agreements with China on jointly advancing the initiative.
Nearly 20 more countries and over 20 international organizations are expected to sign cooperative documents with China during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation from May 14 to 15 in Beijing, which will draw representatives from 110 countries.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's current account surplus remained in a reasonable range in the first quarter, the country's foreign exchange regulator said Monday.
The current account surplus stood at 19 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, with the goods trade surplus standing at 81.7 billion U.S. dollars while the service trade posting a deficit of 60.1 billion U.S. dollars, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement.
The capital and financial account recorded a deficit of 19 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, with a deficit of 100 million U.S. dollars for the capital account.
The non-reserve financial account deficit narrowed markedly to stand at21.5 billion U.S. dollars, down 87 percent year on year, as outbound direct investment fell by 64 percent year on year to reach 20.9 billion U.S. dollars.
China's reserve assets including foreign reserves fell by 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months, narrowing the drop by about 100 percent compared with the previous quarter.
The country's international balance of payment is basically balanced thanks to steady structural reforms and stable economy, the statement added.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Dragged down by declining commodity imports and weakness in external demand, China's foreign trade growth slowed in April, customs data showed Monday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.3 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan (179.8 billion U.S. dollars), down from the 22.3-percent increase in March, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.
Imports increased 18.6 percent to 979.1 billion yuan, compared with a 26.3-percent increase a month ago.
The trade surplus of 262.3 billion yuan, up 0.6 percent year on year, increased from 164.3 billion yuan in March.
Monthly import growth was partly weighed down by a sharp decline in demand for commodities such as iron ore and crude oil, coupled with corrections in commodity prices in April, noted China Merchants Securities (CMS).
In U.S. dollar terms, exports went up 8 percent in April, almost on par with the 8.2-percent gain registered in the first quarter.
"The moderate decline in exports was partly a result of corrections in the U.S. economy," said Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities, "As the corrections are seasonal, we expect exports to pick up in the long term."
While both exports and imports data fell short of investor expectations, growth itself is laudable, especially amid rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment.
During the first four months, trade with the European Union gained 15.5 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of the total. Trade with the United States expanded 20.3 percent to 1.18 trillion yuan, making it China's second largest trade partner.
"Compared to early 2016, when China's trade with the rest of the world contracted, the overall picture remains positive," said Tom Orlik, Bloomberg economist.
"Even so, a slowdown in exports will make it harder for the government to hit its other objectives," he added.
China is in the midst of what proponents are heralding as its harshest crackdown on financial risks in history. The country's top leadership has promised to review financial regulations after the financial watchdog rolled out a string of tightening measures targeting shadow banking and other undesirable practices.
The tightening regulation came as China reported a strong first quarter, with GDP growth hitting 6.9 percent year on year, beating the annual target of around 6.5 percent.
While the performance leaves room for deleveraging efforts, economists warned that policies that were "too aggressive" could weigh down on growth.
"The slower-than-expected growth in April's imports partly reflected the impact of tightening regulations on firms' financing costs and growth expectations," said Deng.
On a positive note, Monday's data indicates improved trade structure.
In the first four months, general trade expanded 21.6 percent year on year to 4.75 trillion yuan, accounting for 56.5 percent of the total trade volume.
Trade of private enterprises grew 21.7 percent to 3.17 trillion yuan in the first four months, accounting for 37.6 percent of the total, 0.4 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Customs data also showed that a leading indicator for China's exports rebounded from 40.2 to 40.7 month on month in April, signaling positive potential in exports.

The financial regulator has been stepping up efforts to guard against risks, which has affected investors' sentiment, according to analysts.
China's top insurance watchdog issued a statement Sunday calling for more to be done to establish a strict, effective supervisory framework.
The statement noted existing loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which it said had facilitated risky practices.
Some Chinese insurers had been found to have used leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, a practice that was linked to volatility in the market at the end of last year.

Didi said it will upgrade its apps on the App Store and Android app markets in other countries so that more travelers can use bilingual services upon arrival in China.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade surplus widened in April as import growth decline outpaced that of exports, customs data showed Monday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.3 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan (179.8 billion U.S. dollars), down from the 22.3-percent increase in March.
Imports expanded 18.6 percent to 979.1 billion yuan, compared with a 26.3-percent increase a month ago.
That leaves a trade surplus of 262.3 billion yuan, up 0.6 percent year on year. The surplus widened from 164.3 billion yuan seen in March.
In the first four months, total trade volume added up to 8.42 trillion yuan, up 20.3 percent year on year.
While the April trade growth fell short of expectations, customs data reflected improved trade structure.
In the first four months, general trade expanded 21.6 percent year on year to 4.75 trillion yuan, accounting for 56.5 percent of the total trade volume.
Trade of private enterprises grew 21.7 percent to 3.17 trillion yuan in the first four months, accounting for 37.6 percent of the total, and 0.4 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Despite rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment, China's imports and exports with major trade partners remained strong.
During the first four months, trade with the European Union gained 15.5 percent year on year to 1.24 trillion yuan, accounting for 14.8 percent of the total. Trade with the United States expanded 20.3 percent to 1.18 trillion yuan, making it China's second largest trade partner.
Customs data also showed that a leading indicator for China's exports rebounded from 40.2 to 40.7 month on month in April, signalling positive potential in exports.

HOHHOT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The first high-speed railway in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region started test runs on Sunday to prepare for the beginning of regular use by the end of July.
The high-speed train ran at a speed of 250 to 275 km per hour on a section from Ulanqab to Hohhot, capital of the region, during Sunday's trial, according to Hohhot Railway Bureau.
The section in Inner Mongolia is part of the high-speed railway that links Hohhot to Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province, the co-host city of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. When it is operational by the end of July, the travel time between Ulanqab and Hohhot will be shortened to 35 minutes from the current one hour.
The 286.8 km-long Zhangjiakou-Hohhot high-speed rail, with a designed speed of 250 km per hour, will be a major high-speed rail in north China upon completion.
It is expected to be completed and put into service in 2018. At that time, the Zhangjiakou-Hohhot high-speed rail will be connected to the Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed rail, which is under construction. The travel time from Hohhot to Beijing will be reduced from the average nine hours to within three hours.

China Focus: Beijing firms bring tech to Belt and Road countries

Editor: MJ
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chen Zhiqiang is celebrating his decision to build a sprawling factory in northern Beijing 18 years ago.
His company, Nuctech, is one of China's leading security inspection equipment producers.
"When construction started in 1999 on our factory in Miyun District, many people thought it was too big, a waste. But the company has developed greatly, and nobody doubts my decision now," he said.
Since its founding in 1997, Nuctech has expanded several times. The Miyun factory, covering about 100,000 square meters, has become a large production base for exports. It also has factories in Poland and Brazil.
At the Miyun factory, workers are testing several car scanners which they plan to ship to Mexico. The company plans to export about 20,000 pieces of inspection equipment overseas in the coming months.
"Nuctech products have been used at many foreign ports and customs," said Chen. In 2016, exports made up 60 percent of the total sales volume, he added.
Nuctech is among the companies that have expanded swiftly since the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013.
"If there were no Belt and Road Initiative, we would still go out and look for business opportunities, but business has been a lot easier with the initiative coming along," said Chen.
"Our overseas partners are more ready to cooperate because they know they can also benefit greatly," he added.
Another Beijing company, OriginWater, was founded in 2001, four years after Nuctech. Both companies originated in Zhongguancun, known as China's Silicon Valley.
Banking on domestic success in providing safe water solution, OriginWater has sold products in countries including Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Nano-membrane filters developed by the company can block the pollutants and purify water. Vice manager He Yuanping said the technology could have broad applications in water-scarce countries and regions.
"We are working on an agreement in Oman," He said.
He said it is still not easy to seek business in foreign countries.
"It is important to understand the market before we move in, its legal system and finance situations. We find it easier to work with Chinese companies that are already successful in foreign markets," he said.
"Borrow a boat to sail in the sea -- we will find more ways to use the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
"Chinese companies are developing fast, especially hi-tech firms. Many are ready to create value and spread their technology," said Zhang Xiaodong, head of the promotion association of Belt and Road in Zhongguancun.
MIUI, the phone operating system developed by Chinese smart phone maker Xiaomi, has gathered many fans.
Evgeny Drozdov founded an online forum for MIUI in Russia. "There are about 70,000 clicks every day," he said.
Santi, an Indonesian woman, started working at Xiaomi two years ago. Her job is to respond to questions from local Xiaomi users. "Many netizens are quite active in helping the forum with translation between English and local dialects and Chinese," she said.
According to Xiaomi, starting in 2017, all Xiaomi phones sold in Indonesia will be produced locally.
"The reason why Xiaomi can develop so fast is that it localizes operations, production and consumption," said Wang Yiwei, professor of Renmin University of China.
"The Belt and Road Initiative has disseminated ideas of cooperation and win-win. It has guided Chinese companies to look for their place in the global division of labor and realize common development for all," Wang said.


China Focus: China's capital outflows ease on stable economy, yuan

Editor: MJ
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Pressure from capital flight has eased markedly as the Chinese economy firms up and the yuan stabilizes against the U.S. dollar.
China's forex reserves rose for the third month in a row in April, central bank data showed Sunday.
Forex reserves climbed to 3.0295 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of April from 3.0091 trillion dollars a month earlier, up 0.7 percent month on month, according to statistics from the People's Bank of China.
This was the first time since June 2014 the reserves expanded for three consecutive months.
The country's gold reserves also increased from 73.7 billion U.S. dollars by the end of March to over 75 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) attributed the continuous rise of forex reserves to stable cross-border capital flow and yuan appreciation.
Chinese enterprises have become more rational in buying forex thanks to a firmer economy and a stable yuan, SAFE said in a statement, adding that the size of forex reserves would become more stable in the future as the economy maintains steady expansion and the foreign exchange rate stays in a reasonable range.
There had been growing concerns about capital flowing out of the Chinese market in the second half of 2016, when the economy was facing looming downward pressure and the Chinese yuan was in the middle of a losing streak against the U.S. dollar.
In January, China's forex reserves declined below the closely watched 3-trillion-dollar mark for the first time since February 2011.
However, concerns about capital outflows have receded lately, with the Chinese economy on firmer footing, supported by a string of upbeat data including industrial profits, factory activity and fixed-asset investment.
The Chinese economy expanded 6.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, up 0.1 percent compared with Q4 2016.
However, the world's second-largest economy showed signs of softening momentum as the latest PMI data pointed to slower expansion of manufacturing and service activities in April, possibly due to tightening financial regulation.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark interest rates unchanged as the central bank waited on more data to assess the U.S. economic outlook.
Most investors expected a rate hike at the Fed's June 13-14 meeting, which might add pressure for yuan weakness and capital outflows.
China does not want nor need to depreciate its currency to gain export competitiveness, and the PBOC's moves to inject liquidity into the forex market aim to avoid irrational depreciation and market panic, Pan Gongsheng, head of SAFE, wrote in the latest edition of China Finance, a leading industry magazine managed by the central bank.
"China's efforts to improve foreign exchange rate flexibility while maintaining stability are good for the world as they avoid spillover of disorderly yuan fluctuations and competitive depreciation of major currencies," Pan added.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's courier sector posted strong growth in 2016 thanks to continued efforts to boost consumption and services, according to the State Post Bureau (SPB).
The sector generated 397.44 billion yuan (about 57.58 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue last year, up 43.5 percent year on year, the bureau said.
A total of 31.28 billion deliveries were made last year, up 51.4 percent year on year, the bureau said.
The SPB data showed that Guangzhou was the city with the most express deliveries made last year, followed by Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing and Hangzhou.
The country plans to extend the courier network and improve computerized systems, services and international connections by 2020.
The target annual revenue of the courier sector will be 800 billion yuan by 2020, according to a policy document released by the State Council last October.
A survey conducted by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing and e-commerce giant JD.com in April showed that about 80 percent of the surveyed 4,363 delivery men are satisfied with their earnings, while nearly 90 percent of them worked for eight to 12 hours due to rapid business growth.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial watchdogs pledged to offer financial support for the sustainable development of the Belt and Road Initiative ahead of a high-level international meeting.
Funding of projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative should be raised through a market-oriented, sustainable and mutually beneficial investment and financing system, Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan wrote in the latest edition of China Finance, a leading industry magazine managed by the People's Bank of China.
No single country can afford to finance all the projects alone, and it will take mutual efforts from countries involved in the initiative to offer long-term, sustainable financial support, Zhou added.
Fang Xinghai, deputy head of China's top securities watchdog, also wrote in the magazine that they will encourage outstanding Belt and Road-related enterprises to go public in China and overseas markets to finance major projects.
China will support banks to optimize their networks in Belt and Road countries and work with other countries to improve cross-border regulation, wrote Wang Zhaoxing, deputy head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission.
Wang pointed out that Chinese banks should enhance overseas market risk management and report major risks in a timely manner.
Chinese insurers will use their advantages and help finance infrastructure projects that require long-term and massive investment under the initiative while guarding against risks, according to Chen Wenhui, deputy head of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will convene in Beijing from May 14 to 15, with the aim of strengthening partnership on the Belt and Road Initiative and advancing international cooperation for development.


China to toughen insurance sector supervision

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top insurance watchdog decided to toughen supervision of the industry to guard against financial risks.
Insurance regulators at all levels should shore up weak parts of the regulation to build a strict and effective supervision framework, according to a statement released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission on Sunday.
The statement pointed out that there are some loopholes in the current insurance regulation, which have given rise to risky practices in recent years such as disorderly buying of stakes and unchecked growth of risky business.
Chinese insurers grabbed headlines for using leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies, triggering sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
Insurance funds should not invest in risky products and there will be tougher supervision over equity changes of insurers.
Companies with risky business expansion will be targeted and regulators will blacklist senior management for practices that violate regulations and laws, according to the statement.
In February, China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pharmaceutical-related listed companies reported robust profit growth in the first quarter of this year, fresh evidence of the firming economy, Xinhua-run China Securities Journal said Saturday.
As of Saturday, 245 publicly traded Chinese pharmaceutical companies have released their first-quarter reports, and their combined net profits rose 7.6 percent year on year to 21.9 billion yuan (3.2 billion U.S. dollars).

However, the net profit growth was outpaced by the 18-percent business revenue expansion in the same period, said the newspaper citing data compiled by Wind, a leading information service provider.
In the first three months, 28 companies witnessed their net profits surge by more than 50 percent and another 14 companies' net profits were more than doubled.
The performance was mainly buttressed by fast growth of the chemical agents and Internet medical retailer sectors, it said.

KIGALI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Located on one of the hills at "The Land of a Thousand hills," the Vision City project is part of the Rwandan government's efforts to solve housing challenges in the capital city Kigali.
The first phase of the project, the biggest housing project in Rwanda, is consisted of 504 units of villas and apartments. According to the plan, after all the four phases are completed, the project will have the capacity to accommodate over 22,000 people.
"Every time I came here to work, I see the project, I wish I can live here, I'm going to work hard," said Umubyeyi Sandrine, a Rwandan working at the site for China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), a Chinese company undertaking the first phase of the project.
"I hope they call it a vision city, because it's going with a vision and a plan," said the 25-year-oldspider secretary. "It's a vision city because everyone can look at this and say 'we have a vision, even me I have a vision'."
Kigali could have a housing deficit of up to 350,000 residential units in 10 years, if nothing is done to address the current shortage, a study conducted by the Rwandan government and European Union in 2012 showed.
At least 43,436 social houses and 186,163 affordable houses are required annually by 2022, reflecting 54 percent housing demand, according to the city master plan of Kigali.
"This is the first kind in the country, the best one, with good view and good planning, everything is the first here," said Uwifashije Emmanuel, a 31-year-oldspider electrician of CCECC.
"It is called Vision City, and this is the city of vision exactly, which has a good vision. It brings changes to the country, and helps development of Rwanda slowly by slowly. After finishing the entire project, it will be very good for our country," said Emmanuel.
Like Vision City, other projects of CCECC also have good changes to the landlocked country in terms of development, according to him.
"CCECC has built many landmark buildings in Rwanda," General Manager of CCECC in Rwanda Wang Lei told Xinhua."including a major stadium of Rwanda the Amahoro stadium, the tallest building in Kigali Kigali Tower City, the biggest business center of Kigali M. Peace Plaza and etc."
CCECC has been committing to fulfilling its social responsibility like providing free training to Rwandan workers, offering them opportunities to learn skills at the project site.
The Chinese company also helps create jobs for local people, said Wang, adding that there were 3,000 local people working in the vision city project throughout the year of 2015.
CCECC has cultivated many local workers into skilled workers under direction of the company's Chinese staff, he said.
"CCECC taught me electrical and mechanical knowledge," said Emmanuel, who has been working in CCECC since 2008.



Spotlight: More than just China's pride, C919 "win-win" for global market

by Xinhua Writer Guo Shuang
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first indigenously-designed large passenger aircraft, the C919, successfully completed its maiden flight on Friday in the eastern city of Shanghai, providing a win-win cooperation for both China and the global market.
"The C919 not only generates a great source of pride for China, but also represents mutual benefits and cooperation between China and the rest of the world. For this reason, the C919 program also carries the pride and hopes of people across the globe," Ye Wei, executive director and president of COMAC America Corporation, told Xinhua in an interview on Thursday at his office in Los Angeles, California.
The successful flying of C919 is a crucial step in earning its manufacturer, COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China), a position alongside Airbus and Boeing as a major player in the large passenger aircraft industry, where the three players could become known as the "ABC" of aircraft manufacturing.
AVIATION INNOVATION
Out of the overall design of the C919, the airframe is, from its initial design to calculations, testing, and construction, independently researched and developed in China.
The research and development of the airframe gave rise to multiple technical breakthroughs, such as the unique design of the supercritical wing and different applications of new construction materials.
While some may consider the airframe to just be the shell of an aircraft, Ye emphasized that the development of the airframe represents a major technical component of large aircraft manufacturing. As one of the most difficult steps in the aircraft design process, the C919's airframe technology represents a major step forward for China's aircraft manufacturing industry.
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
At the same time, the C919 can be considered a paragon of global cooperation. Major components such as the engines, avionics, control systems, and more are sourced from numerous joint ventures and partners across Europe and the United States.
With major suppliers such as General Electric and Honeywell, the C919 project can be said to cover the world. The C919 features major components from 17 Level 1 suppliers around the globe, with Level 2 and 3 suppliers numbering in the hundreds.
"This is why the C919 is more than just China's pride. It also represents mutual benefit that stretches far beyond China's borders," Ye said.
In order to succeed in an increasingly globalized business world, international cooperation is a must. From this point of view, the C919 provides significant economic benefits to each of its international suppliers and their nations.
In posts on its social media accounts, Honeywell stated that with nearly 1,000 of their employees across the world working to support the C919 project, the entire Honeywell workforce shared COMAC's pride at the success of the first flight.
Darius Adamczyk, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell was one of the first to send his congratulations to COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, which read: "We are extremely proud that COMAC chose Honeywell to provide four major systems for this sleek and modern aircraft. We are proud of our partnership with COMAC and eager to continue to help advance aviation capabilities in China."
NO THREAT TO BOEING, AIRBUS
At the moment, China's large passenger aircraft have a long way to go before they can truly compete with Boeing and Airbus on the international market, much less present a genuine threat to either manufacturer. Over a considerably long timeframe, the C919 is planned to mainly be used in China's domestic market, helping to meet its demand.
In the short term, production of the C919 will be limited and its numbers will be far from enough to make a significant impact. At the moment, the C919 has a total of 570 orders, the vast majority of which were made by domestic Chinese customers.
In fact, at the moment Boeing and Airbus are enthusiastically cooperating with COMAC, making use of the Chinese company's manpower and resources to develop the Chinese aviation market.
As one of COMAC's major international partners, Aviage Systems is responsible for three avionics work packages on the C919.
Immediately following the first flight of C919, company Chairman and CEO Alan Jones sent COMAC his best wishes, stating "Aviage Systems is very proud to be COMAC's close partner as both sides worked with common purpose, encouraging each other and overcoming obstacles along the way. We are honored to be a part of this historical occasion."
Regarding the significance of the first flight and the road ahead, Robert Morefield, a senior aeronautical engineer with over 40 years of experience in the industry,said, "The success of the C919's first flight is a critical step in the comprehensive test flight process. This milestone opens the path for a multitude of required future test flights that will ensure the aircraft is safe and ready for public service."
However, among congratulations from all over the world, there were some who used the occasion to politicize the C919 program and treat it as if it was a threat to the rest of the world.
"This is a very shortsighted way of looking at it," said Ye, referring to these criticisms. "With cooperation comes mutual benefit. I think this is something people of every nation would like to see," he said.
"If other countries were to refuse this cooperation and place unnecessary embargoes and limitations on these kinds of projects, it would only harm the idea of a fair and open market and ultimately damage the economic welfare of individuals throughout the world," Ye said.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 33 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) went on China's New Third Board last week, data showed Saturday.
The newcomers brought the number of companies listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) to 11,123.P Turnover on the board stood at 3.33 billion yuan (around 483 million U.S. dollars) last week.
NEEQ, also known as the "New Third Board," was officially launched in early 2013 to supplement the main Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses in serving SMEs.
It is seen as an easy financing channel for small businesses with low costs and simple listing procedures.

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China's homegrown C919 passenger plane completed its first public flight test on Friday, marking a milestone in the development of China's civil aviation industry.
The successful flight signals China's entry into the global aviation market, and moves the country one step closer to transforming itself from a manufacturer of low-cost goods to a creator of advanced technology.
AVIATION AT NEW LEVEL
Aviation experts have hailed the strong growth momentum of China's aviation industry, which, they said, has taken an important step in the right direction.
"This event can only be welcome. This indicates that the Chinese aviation industry is gaining momentum and is rising to a new level," said Nikolay Yakubovich, an aviation engineer and aviation historian in Russia.
The twin-engine C919 is made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). With a standard range of 4,075 km, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes.
Michel Merluzeau, director of Aerospace & Defence Market Analysis for AirInsightResearch in Seattle, was also impressed by the great efforts made by the Chinese government in accelerating innovation.
"What really impresses me with COMAC and with Chinese aerospace industry as a whole is that, we have traditional aerospace cycles in Europe and North America every 10, 15 years," Merluzeau said.
The aviation expert noted that there are two things to understand: First, "the role of Chinese government to accelerate innovation and to push innovation and program very fast." Second, "the ability of COMAC to probably innovate fast and shake up what we see as a cycle here in North America."
Merluzeau also expressed confidence in the future development of COMAC, the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919.
"I think by 2030, 2035, COMAC may very well do well in aircraft together to compete with the new aircrafts of Airbus and Boeing," said Merluzeau.
However, despite the successful test flight, it still takes time for the C919 to take off in the market.
GAINING EXPERIENCE IN AVIATION
Shaking the dominance of giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, as the experts have pointed out, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come.
"I believe that this first Chinese passenger airliner will find a niche, and will occupy an important place in the domestic Chinese market, as well as will start some kind of advance to the outside market," said Vasily Kashin, a senior research fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics (HSE).
Kashin said that C919's development, production and operation will allow China to accumulate experience, and at the next stage, when a new airplane generation or a new significantly improved version of C919 is developed, to release a full-fledged competitor, which can challenge Boeing and Airbus.
"Using a number of existing advantages, including the possibility of some price reduction due to its own very large domestic market and the attraction of cheap credit resources from Chinese state-owned banks, China will be able to compete seriously with American and European producers and catch up with them," Kashin said.
FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC MARKET
A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to COMAC.
But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success.
"Over the very long term COMAC is likely to become a major player in the airline segment," said Douglas Royce, senior aerospace analyst at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm in the United States.
However, the expert also pointed out it is not something that will happen over the next decade, but rather a long-term process that will require ongoing support from the Chinese government.
At least in the early years of service, demand will be centered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets, said Royce, adding that Airbus and Boeing have spent decades competing fiercely against each other and are lean and mean in the airliner market.
"The world market is so complex and competitive that it is difficult to hope that it will be possible to break into it immediately with a product that will beat all others and drive out all competitors," Kashin said, echoing Royce's remarks.
Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for more than 6,000 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars.
The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field as it is economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on Friday questioned the European Commission's (EC) anti-subsidy ruling on Chinese hot-rolled coil, criticizing improper practices in the investigation.
The commission has ruled that Chinese producers of the steel product received subsidies ranging from 4.9 percent to 42.6 percent.
Ignoring the fact that Chinese commercial banks operated independently in accordance with market principles, the EC asserted their loans to the producers were preferential lending, said Wang Hejun, head of the trade remedy and investigation bureau at the MOC.
The commission also wrongly took banking loans obtained by state firms as bestowal, which inflated the subsidy range, Wang said.
China urged the EC to strictly abide by WTO rules to correct the improper ruling as soon as possible, he stressed, pledging to take necessary measures to defend the rights of Chinese companies.
Hot-rolled coil, a major variety of steel product, is widely used in construction and machinery building.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The central government will encourage insurance funds to invest in public-private-partnership (PPP) projects to boost the economy, the country's top insurance watchdog announced Friday.
Insurance funds can finance PPP enterprises under their infrastructure investment plans by means of debt, equity or a combination of the two, according to a statement released by China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
CIRC will speed up approvals for financing PPP projects related to programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative, development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River economic belt and the Xiongan New Area, and poverty-alleviation projects.
The central government is looking to PPP, a collaborative investment model between government and private companies, as a way to fund infrastructure projects amid concerns over high local government debt.
Last year, the number of signed PPP projects and total investment more than quadrupled from 2015, with private enterprises participating in more regions and sectors than ever before.
The strong momentum continued into the first quarter of 2017, which saw 28 percent more PPP projects inked year on year.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's central government announced plans Friday to reward regions that beat benchmarks in cutting overcapacity, budget management, encouraging public-private-partnerships(PPP), supporting employment and poverty relief.
Financial support and favorable policies will be granted to regions which make solid progress in such areas, according to a Ministry of Finance statement.
A special fund worth 100 billion yuan (about 14.5 billion U.S. dollars) will be allocated to nine provinces, which beat government targets or fulfill tasks ahead of schedule in cutting overcapacity in steel and coal, the statement said.
Official data indicates that China has eliminated steel production capacity by more than 65 million tonnes and coal by over 290 million tonnes in the last year.
Also, a total of 10 provinces are scheduled to be awarded for better budget enforcement, budget openness and debt control.
For regions which take the lead in encouraging PPP projects, as ways to fund infrastructure projects and ease the debt burden on local governments, awards will be granted based on their investment scales.
Achievements in improving livelihoods, including supporting employment and relieving poverty, will also be rewarded through favorable policies.
The ministry pledged early allocation of funds and urged local governments to conduct inspections on their allocation.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The central parity rate of the Chinese currency renminbi, or the yuan, strengthened 73 basis points to 6.8884 against the U.S. dollar Friday, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
Prospects of a June U.S. interest rate hike have not dampened confidence in domestic liquidity. Analysts said the yuan will remain stable with narrow fluctuations.
Foreign trade will be in a better position thanks to structural improvements and improved efficiency and more growth momentum, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce.
Boosted by a pickup in external demand and a stable domestic economy, China's trade with the rest of the world grew strongly in the first quarter.
In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.
The central parity rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day.

The maiden flight of the C919 is scheduled for May 5. The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- While the much-awaited first Chinese-built passenger jet C919 is ready to make its maiden flight Friday, it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market.
Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come.
Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737.
A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).
But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success.
Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus.
China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022.
China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars.
Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts.
But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive.
Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars.
China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing.
The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities.
If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries.
Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU.
China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line.
The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.

NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pan-African investment insurer African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI) is seeking closer ties with Chinese firms so as to increase investment flows into the continent, officials said on Thursday.
ATI Chief Underwriting Officer John Lentaigne told Xinhua that Africa is still perceived to be a risky investment destination despite its high rates of investment returns.
"So we want to partner with Chinese firms so they feel more confident in investing in Africa," Lentaigne said when ATI released its financial results for 2016.
"Already, we are seeing demand from Chinese companies that want to protect their investments," he noted.
Chinese investments into Africa have accelerated over the past decade to play an increasingly important role in the socio-economic development of the continent.
The ATI official noted that currently most Chinese firms depend on Chinese state insurers to mitigate their risks in Africa.
"We want to partner with Chinese firms so that we help them explore other alternatives to mitigate their risk," he said.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities on Thursday released an action plan to boost the recycling industry amid government efforts to promote green and sustainable growth.
By 2020, China aims to increase the output value of the resource recycling industry to 3 trillion yuan (434.8 billion U.S. dollars), a jump of 67 percent from the 2015 level, according to the plan jointly released by 14 agencies including the top economic planner and environmental watchdog.
The resource productivity ratio should rise by 15 percent from the 2015 level, and the recycling utilization ratio of major waste should reach 54.6 percent by 2020, said the plan.
Through the efforts, China hopes to foster a green, low carbon development model to encourage green lifestyles and green consumption among the public.
The plan came as the Chinese government is intensifying efforts to address rampant pollution and build a greener economy for long-term good.
In the country's 13th Five-Year Plan for the 2016-2020 period, the government has made green development one of its major priorities.
According to a government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang in March, China aims to cut the energy consumption per unit of GDP by at least 3.4 percent in 2017, while targeting continued reductions in the emission of major pollutants.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's imports and exports are likely to continue their upward trend this year but pressure will remain due to external uncertainties, a report said Thursday.
Foreign trade will be in a better position thanks to improving structure and efficiency and more growth momentum, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce.
The sound fundamentals have remained unchanged and local companies still have advantages in global trade, said the report.
Boosted by a pickup in external demand and a stable domestic economy, China's trade with the rest of the world grew strongly in the first quarter.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.8 percent year on year, while imports jumped 31.1 percent. The trade surplus dropped 35.7 percent.
The report warned of a still grim trade situation and called for continued efforts to ensure steady development, citing a shaky recovery of external demand, more competition and trade frictions.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen its regulation on think tanks, according to a national guideline released Thursday.
The guideline, issued by nine ministerial-level departments including the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Public Security, stipulates that think tanks operating in the mainland possess legal person status, and should be run by domestic social organizations.
Think tanks should carry out activities for the purpose of serving the Party and government decision-making, the guideline said.
They should abide by state laws and regulations while enhancing their awareness of social responsibility, according to the guideline.
The guideline also stipulates a dual-management system for think tanks.
Private-run think tanks should register with the provincial civil affairs department and be supervised by the federation of social science circles at the provincial level.
Other think tanks will be supervised by authorities in related fields and register with civil departments of the same level as the authorities in charge.
Unregistered social organizations are forbidden to operate in the name of think tanks, the guideline said.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Belt and Road Initiative is by no means a strategy to export China's industrial overcapacity, but a proposal that brings shared benefits to all, an expert said Thursday.
Since the launch of the initiative in 2013, China has been sharing its expertise in fields such as infrastructure construction and clean energy with countries and regions along the Belt and Road, helping them with their own industrial upgrades, Wang Yiwei, a professor at the School of International Relations at Renmin University, said in a press briefing.
For example, a Chinese company helped build a power station in Indonesia's resort island of Bali, using its expertise in clean energy to make the plant almost pollution-free.
While the initiative was originally proposed by China, it is an open and inclusive proposal that welcomes participation from all sides, Wang said.
The upcoming Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation will be a great opportunity for global leaders to discuss a concrete mechanism for project implementation in various fields, Wang said.
By the end of April 18, 28 heads of state and government leaders had confirmed they would attend the BRF, which will be held in Beijing from May 14 to 15.
 


China to make insurance more supportive to real economy

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's top insurance regulator has moved to strengthen the sector's role of supporting the real economy in its latest effort to improve supervision over fast-growing insurance companies.
In a guideline released Thursday, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission rolled out an array of measures "to create a sound policy environment for the insurance sector to serve the real economy" and improve its quality and efficiency.
Insurance funds will receive stronger encouragement to be used in national development strategies, including supply-side structural reform, the debt-to-equity swap program, the Belt and Road, poverty relief, and the manufacturing improvement plan known as "Made in China 2025."
By the end of March, insurance companies had channeled more than 4 trillion yuan (around 580 billion U.S. dollars) into infrastructure construction, renovation of rundown areas and other programs related to people's livelihood.
More efforts will be made to promote insurance for environmental pollution, food safety and farm produce, said the guideline.
The commission also vowed improved supervision, with better capital regulation, differentiated regulatory measures and a negative list for equity investment.
Total insurance premium income in China jumped 27.5 percent year on year in 2016, and the sector's combined assets had amounted to 15.12 trillion yuan by the end of December.

More Chinese cities restrict property sales

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- In its latest efforts to cool runaway housing prices, Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, put restrictions on property sales in more counties, effective Thursday.
Local authorities have stipulated that houses in eight counties purchased after May 3 cannot be sold within three years after purchase.
More than 20 cities -- mainly second- and third-tier cities in China -- have introduced restrictive policies to intensify property market regulations since April.
The new regulation in Zhengzhou will slash speculative demand in the local property market and boost stable development, said Yan Yuejin, senior researcher with E-house China R&D Institute.
Zhang Dawei, a senior analyst with Centaline Property, said that speculative capital is flowing to hot areas without sales restrictions due to tightened regulations, especially in large cities, which will lead more cities to step up regulatory measures.
"Ten more third- and fourth-tier cities around Xiongan New Area have rolled out house purchase restrictions," said Yang Kewei, researcher with property research center CRIC, adding that cities like Zhuhai, Dongguan and Jiaxing, which surround first-tier cities, have scaled up their purchase bans recently.
Restrictions on property sales have become a trump card for many cities. So far, over 20 cities have rolled out similar restrictions.
"Sales restrictions are local governments' new method to regulate property markets, featuring the latest round of tightened regulation beginning in March," said Zhang.
Yang also pointed out that sales restrictions are going to be part of the long-term mechanism of property market regulation, combined with purchase bans and credit limits.

Commentary: China means business with its tough financial regulation

By Xinhua writer Zhang Zhongkai
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China is in the midst of what proponents are heralding as its harshest crackdown on financial risks in history: a campaign that is by no means a fleeting gesture.
This is not the first time that the central authorities has stressed to address financial risks, but a such a concerted, comprehensive push is rare.
China's top leadership promised last week to review financial regulations after the financial watchdog rolled out a string of tightening measures targeting shadow banking and other undesirable practices.
The authorities' determination is undoubtable, however, supervisory tightening could face challenges in the short term.
The results of official and private surveys indicate that China's manufacturing activities were easing expansion, and jitters over tightening policies are already palpable on the financial markets, stoking sentiment of an abrupt end to tightening.
One thing is clear: China will not backtrack -- deleveraging is good for the economy.
Regulation released this week targeted local debt and illegal fund-raising.
While the country's overall leverage ratio is manageable, in some sectors it is expanding at an alarming pace.
The authorities are on top of financial risks. A financial crisis occurs when those in power bury their heads in the sand and refuse to act. Here, the challenges have been recognized, but it is important that they are dealt with in a timely manner and with the correct measures.
Leverage comes by the pound and goes away by the ounce. The stockpile of debt from previous governmental over-stimulus alongside poor corporate management and lax financial supervision will take time to digest.
Deleveraging is no overnight task. It will be a gradual process calling for a delicate balance between tightening regulation and avoiding financial turmoil.
Poor coordination among financial regulators has the potential to lead to faster-than-intended slowdown of credit growth and greater market volatility, throwing the economy into a downward trap.
At the end of the day, sustainable growth is the fundamental target. China should watch its pace when deleveraging the economy to ensure the financial sector is under pressure to continue to reduce leverage while avoiding any systemic financial crisis.
The war against financial risks is already on and it will take time and planning to see financial markets return to a sustainable track.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks continued to edge down Thursday, as weakening service expansion data made investors worried about economic contraction.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dipped 0.25 percent to end the day at 3,127.37 points, down for a third consecutive day.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.36 percent lower at 10,147.44 points. The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, ended 0.13 percent lower to close at 1,838.10 points.
China's service sector continued to moderate in April, as Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 51.5 in April from 52.2 in March, the lowest in 11 months.
Both official and private surveys showed that the country's manufacturing activity eased expansion in April, partly due to recent tightening of financial regulation.
China's top securities regulator on Wednesday vowed to step up efforts to prevent and control financial risks.
Many shares related to Xiongan New Area posted a roller coaster performance on Thursday. Tangshan Jidong Equipment and Engineering Co. Ltd. rose by almost 8 percent during trading time and closed by falling over 4 percent.

Economic Watch: China's service activity moderates amid slowing economy

Editor: MJ
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Growth in Chinese service sector business activity continued to soften in April as a private survey showed Thursday that an index for the sector fell to the lowest in 11 months.
The Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks over 400 service sector companies in China, slipped to 51.5 in April from 52.2 in March, according to the survey sponsored by Caixin Media Co. Ltd.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 represents contraction.
The decline follows a drop in the Caixin Manufacturing PMI to 50.3 last month from 51.2 in March.
As a result, the Caixin China Composite Output Index, which covers both manufacturing and services, fell to 51.2 in April from 52.1 in the previous month, the lowest in the past 10 months.
"Growth in both manufacturing and services decelerated in April, reflecting a clear slowdown in the expansion of the Chinese economy," said Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, a subsidiary of Caixin Insight Group.
In breakdown, the business activity index posted only a modest expansion. Growth in new orders picked up and stayed solid. The rate of job creation was the slowest seen in 2017 so far and modest overall.
On the bright side, Chinese service providers saw a slower increase in overall cost burdens in April, with the rate of input price inflation easing to a six-month low.
Service companies remained generally optimistic that business activity will increase over the next year in April. However, the degree of positive sentiment slipped to a five-month low, according to the survey.
The weakening trend is in line with the official service sector PMI, which came in at 54 in April, down from 55.1 in March, according to the the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The service sector has played an increasingly important role in the Chinese economy, as it creates nearly half of the country's jobs, and is critical to rebalance the economy from labor-intensive manufacturing to service economy and consumer spending.
In the first quarter, the service sector accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy. In terms of growth, it has left agriculture and the secondary industry far behind.
However, service activity growth has softened in each month of 2017 so far, as tepid growth in the manufacturing sector weighed on manufacturing-related service industries.
The Chinese government has rolled out a slew of policies to support service sector companies. In 2016, it introduced value-added (VAT) reform, the most significant tax overhaul for two decades, to reduce the burden on service industries, which have historically paid a disproportionate share.
In 2016, the number of newly established businesses in the service sector increased by a brisk 25 percent, hiring 43.5 percent of the labor force, compared with 36 percent in 2012.
China has had a strong start this year, with GDP expanding 6.9 percent in the first quarter, well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.
"A turning point in growth appeared to have emerged at the beginning of the second quarter. Investors should be cautious about downward risks in the economy," said Zhong Zhengsheng.

Economic Watch: Risk control, restructuring keynote of China's macro regulations

Editor: An
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The keynote of China's macroeconomic regulations will be risk control and restructuring in the coming months as major macro data for April point in that direction.
Mild inflation, fast-growing investment in infrastructure, falling new loans and reduced factory gate prices all point to the need for improved risk control and continued restructuring, according to analysts.
NEW LOANS FALL
Given seasonal factors, new loans in April are likely to decline from March, said Lian Ping, chief economist at Bank of Communications, quoted by China Securities Journal. "The ratio of medium and long-term credit for residents may gradually drop due to tightened real estate regulation."
Zhu Jianfang, chief economist with Citic Securities, noted the amount of growth in April mortgages might reduce significantly. He said the country's credit expansion may slow down this year due to prudent monetary policies, and the growth of outstanding loans is under downward pressure.
"The monetary policy mix of quantitative control and low interest rates will remain unchanged as economic stability tops the government agenda," said Hu Yuexiao, chief economist of Shanghai Securities.
While some worried intensive financial regulation would affect the country's economic growth, the April monetary and credit figures would show improving policy coordination among regulators, said Liang Hong, chief economist with China International Capital Corporation Limited.
Liang predicted that the adjusted growth of social financing would remain around 15.6 percent in April.
INFLATIONARY PRESSURE LOW
Pork prices are expected to report a sharp decline of above 7 percent year on year in April due to a high base last year, and prices of fresh vegetables might continue a seasonal fall, said Zhu, adding prices of aquatic products and grains might rise slightly to pull inflation.
Lian made a preliminary prediction that the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) might increase about 1 to 1.2 percent from the same period of last year, slightly higher compared to March. He said the CPI might drop in the second half of this year due to prudent monetary policies and weak demand.
"There is no obvious inflationary pressure in 2017," Lian said, predicting that the full-year CPI may drop to around 2 percent.
As for growth of the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, Zhu predicted a month-on-month drop of 1.3 percentage points to 6.3 percent in April and a near-zero growth rate at the end of the year due to the high base effect.
INVESTMENT GROWTH FLAT
Lu Zhengwei, chief economist with the Industrial Bank, predicted 9.3-percent year-on-year growth of fixed-asset investment for the first four months of 2017, up 0.1 percentage point from the January-March period.
Property investment might rise in April as the growth of commercial house sales is still faster than that of real estate investment, which will contribute to boost the country's fixed asset investment, Lu said.
Liang forecast that urban fixed-asset investment would rise 9 percent year on year from January to April, flat with the first quarter.
Investment in the manufacturing and private sectors may keep rising as profits of industrial enterprises recovered substantially, Liang said.
Thanks to efficient risk control and economic restructuring, China's economy has shown signs of firming, reinforced by an expanding manufacturing sector, rising corporate profits, increased rail freight volume, and higher machinery sales.
The country has lowered its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest target in a quarter of a century, as the government leaves room for economic rebalancing.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhuanet) -- The wolfberry industry, with a total annual output value of 13 billion yuan, has become a major industry in northwest China’s Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, according to the latest data from the Ningxia Forestry Bureau.

By the end of 2016, wolfberry plantations occupied over 900,000 mu (60,000 hectares) in Ningxia, producing 93,000 tons of dried wolfberry and more than 40 deep-processed products such as beverage, seeding oil and health products.

With the brand effect, Ningxia has accelerated its wolfberry industry towards more export-oriented development.

Over 60 producers now export dried wolfberry and deep-processed products to over 50 countries and regions.

Their export volume exceeds 5,000 tons, taking up 60 percent of the nation's total, with a market share increasing by 15-20 percent annually.

Ningxia is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, with great sun light and heat resources ideal for growing quality wolfberry.

In recent years, Ningxia adheres to the modern agricultural development ideas and provides great support to the wolfberry industry which has been further enhanced.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage bond issuance to facilitate public-private-partnership (PPP) projects, the country's top economic planner announced Wednesday.
The government will accelerate approvals for bonds issuance in PPP projects and issue favorable policies to firms with high credence ratings, according to a guideline released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
The guideline aims to make more financing options available for PPP projects in the areas of infrastructure and public service, said NDRC.
NDRC requires bond issuers to disclose information including possible risks, and protection mechanisms to investors before trading.
China has been looking to PPP, a collaborative investment model between government and private companies, as a way to fund infrastructure projects amid concerns over high local government debt.
Last year, the number of signed PPP projects and total investment more than quadrupled from 2015, with private enterprises participating in more regions and sectors than ever before.
The strong momentum continued into the first quarter of 2017, which saw 28 percent more PPP projects inked year on year.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's large commercial banks have been asked to set up inclusive finance departments to support small companies, agriculture, poverty relief and entrepreneurship before the end of 2017.
Large banks should become the backbone in the development of inclusive finance, according to a statement following a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday.
Their lending to small and micro enterprises should rise no slower than growth in all loans, the statement said, adding that the number of small and micro borrowers in a year should not be lower than the same period of the previous year.
Banks should tolerate a reasonably higher non-performing loan ratio for lending to small and micro enterprises, agriculture and poverty alleviation, according to the statement.
The government will offer monetary and credit policy incentives to financial institutions that meet the requirements for inclusive finance businesses, and support commercial banks to improve their service networks.
"By coordinating different measures, inclusive and convenient financial services will promote job creation, economic upgrading and improvement of people's lives," the statement said.
The executive meeting decided to raise the subsidy for emergency assistance efforts in natural disasters, the pension for family members of the deceased from major disasters, life assistance fund in the transitional period and central government subsidy for recovering and rebuilding damaged residential buildings.
In 2017, the country should solve the housing problems for all the people still staying in temporary places affected by natural disasters last year.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China is moving to correct irregular behavior in the fundraising of local governments as part of efforts to rein in financial risks amid a firming economy.
In a notice released Wednesday, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) asked provincial authorities to start self-examining their financing practices as soon as possible and to rectify all irregularities by the end of July, with progress to be tracked by MOF local supervisors.
The relationship between governments and local financing platforms should be properly handled, and the latter should transform into market-based state-owned enterprises that can stay clear of government intervention.
Local governments are allowed to set up investment funds with private companies and conduct public-private-partnership cooperation, but debt financing is strictly prohibited.
The MOF will take actions to improve financing systems of local governments, establish a monitoring and risk control mechanism, and promote better information disclosure.
Chinese financial regulators are channeling more energy into risk control and de-leveraging as solid GDP growth in the first quarter has provided more room for such adjustments.

Economic Watch: China counts on aggressive tax cut to spur economy

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- As the biggest tax cut in U.S. history has a domino effect on the rest of the world, China may be about to become more aggressive in cutting its taxes to stay competitive.
China has been trying for years to reduce business costs. May 1 is the one year anniversary of VAT reform, which replaced all business taxes with value-added tax, the most significant tax overhaul for two decades.
Tangible goods have been subject to VAT for some time, but the levy on services was imposed on the value of a firm's sales. Such a crude system resulted in a tax on tax. VAT avoids this, as it is applied to the value added at each link in the production chain.
Since last year, taxes on construction, property, finance and consumer service sectors are on value-added, such as the difference between wholesale and final sales price for a retailer.
According to the State Administration of Taxation, VAT reform cut roughly 680 billion yuan (100 billion U.S. dollars) of tax for business, with some 98 percent of them feeling the difference.
The reform is an attempt to reduce the burden on service industries, which have historically paid a disproportionate share.
In 2016, the number of newly-established businesses in the service sector increased by a brisk 25 percent, hiring 43.5 percent of the labor force, compared with 36 percent in 2012.
Auto maker Geely has benefited from the reform. Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said the new tax scheme eased corporate payment by nearly 493 million yuan in 2016. That gives the company more leverage to increase spending on research.
To fulfill its promise of around 350 billion yuan tax cuts in 2017, government announced new measures in April. From July 1, value-added tax will be simplified, small businesses will enjoy more income tax incentives, and pre-tax deductions for innovation-based tech companies will rise.
"We must cut non-tax charges along with cutting taxes to reduce the burden on enterprises and raise their competitiveness. The government is responsible for creating a sound environment to achieve these goals," Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said at a State Council meeting in April.
In late April, the U.S. government unveiled the biggest tax cut plan in U.S. history. It plans to reduce the number of income tax brackets and lower the tax on corporations from 35 percent to 15 percent.
While any change to U.S. taxes still needs to be approved by Congress, it could see a wave of companies move back to the United States from overseas.
Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with the Bank of Communications, said the U.S. tax overhaul is expected to reshuffle the global business environment. China needs more tax cuts to stay competitive.
Compared with the United States, China's tax policy is not aggressive enough, he added.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China announced measures Wednesday to encourage research and development (R&D) by tech firms through favorable tax terms, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in a statement.
Small and medium sized-enterprises (SME) in the technological sector can deduct an additional 75 percent of the R&D costs that occurred before paying taxes, effectively lowering their taxable income, according to the statement.
Tech SMEs that chose alternatively to capitalize the R&D costs as intangible assets in the current accounting period can amortize the assets at 175 percent of the original costs.
The new tax term will be in effect from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2019, the statement said.
China has been offering tax incentives to spur corporate dynamism and competitiveness, offering tailored measures to firms of different types.
On Wednesday, the MOF also announced tax incentives for venture capital firms, allowing them to deduct a certain amount of taxable income for investing in startups.
The value added tax (VAT) system will also be streamlined, with four VAT brackets reduced to three, the MOF said.

China to improve SOEs management structure

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's cabinet, on Wednesday released a guideline on corporate governance structure at state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
The guideline clarifies relations between investors, the board of directors, managers and the board of supervisors at state firms, with detailed clarifications of their obligations and responsibilities.
Corporate articles should play a basic role in management of the firms to regulate the activities of different bodies, the guideline stressed.
Although most state firms already have established corporate systems, problems such as unclear responsibilities and lack of checks and balances still exist, the State Council noted.
China hopes to boost the efficiency of SOEs, make them operate in accordance with market principles and assume responsibility for their own profits, losses and risks, according to the guideline, which sets a goal of basically completing the reforms by 2017.
China has thousands of SOEs and more than 100 are directly administered by the central authority. These enterprises are the backbone of the economy, but their monopolies in many areas, unchecked spending and inefficiency are often the source of public complaints.
In a government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang in March, China pledged to deepen SOE reform in 2017, promising measures such as introducing a mixed-ownership system and more efforts to make SOEs leaner,healthier, and perform better.

FRANKFURT, May 3 (Xinhua)-- By raising its stake to 9.92 percent in Deutsche Bank, China's conglomerate HNA Group has become the top single shareholder of the largest German commercial bank headquartered in Frankfurt, according to a filing by investment entity C-Quadrat which manages HNA Group's stake in Deutsche Bank.
For the first time in February, the Chinese conglomerate whose business widely covers aviation, hotels, financial services, tourism, etc. disclosed a stake of nearly 3 percent in Deutsche Bank.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's securities watchdog has pledged more efforts to prevent risks, saying "no hidden risks will be neglected", amid the country's strengthening supervision in the financial sector.

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Premiums received by Chinese insurers rose 32.45 percent in Q1, compared with Q1 last year, official data showed Wednesday.

By the end of March, the industry had combined assets totalling 16.2 trillion yuan, up 7 percent from the beginning of the year.
The commission attributed the steady growth of premium income to better regulation and risk protection.
Since the beginning of this year, financial regulators have worked to prevent systemic risks as the importance of financial security grows. Last month, the CIRC announced a targeted campaign against violations to restore market order, with measures against false capital contributions, chaotic corporate governance, irregular investments and fake data.

TOKYO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said that the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) attracting members from Asia and beyond is a positive for infrastructure development in Asia.
Kuroda, former Asian Development Bank chief, said in a speech recently that in terms of infrastructure development in Asia, there was room for more than just the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
"It's simply not possible for the ADB and the World Bank to fill the gap completely in infrastructure development in Asia," The BOJ chief said during a question and answer session after a speech he made in Yokohama on Tuesday.
He also noted that healthy competition among various players is a positive for infrastructure development and economic growth.
Kuroda was speaking at a gathering of think tanks organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Institute ahead of the 50th annual meeting of the ADB later this week.
The ADB currently comprises 67 member states and regions and has for a long time assisted developing countries with advancement projects by way of loans.
The AIIB's members, however, while not including Japan or the United States, have already stood at 70, with the bank poised to make significant inroads into regional infrastructural development projects.
During his speech, the BOJ chief called on policy makers to ensure that households and businesses have access to financial services, stating that this is key to poverty reduction in Asia.
He also said that removing existing barriers that are currently preventing financial inclusiveness is of paramount importance to reducing poverty.
Kuroda added that information and communication technology will continue to play a large part in the development of Asia by way of helping financial inclusion mechanisms to expand.
The former ADB chief said that economic growth in Asia specifically over the last 50 years has been key to driving down poverty.

Higher fuel prices hit Chinese airline profits

BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite robust passenger growth, most listed Chinese airlines failed to see increased profits in the first quarter due to rising oil prices.
All publicly traded Chinese carriers have released their first-quarter reports, and most reported waning profitability as higher fuel costs hit profit margins, Xinhua-run China Securities Journal reported Wednesday.
China Southern Airlines, the country's biggest carrier by passenger volume, saw net profits slump 42.44 percent year on year to 1.55 billion yuan (about 225 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, despite a 10.58-percent growth in business revenue to 30.97 billion yuan. Rising fuel prices pushed up China Southern Airlines' operational costs by 21 percent year on year.
Pressure from higher fuel costs are reflected in other carrier reports. Air China, the country's national flag carrier, saw net profit plunge 39.8 percent year on year to 1.47 billion yuan. Hainan Airlines saw net profit drop 42 percent to 835 million yuan.
Smaller carriers saw their profits declining by a small magnitude, with Juneyao Airlines and Spring Airlines registering net profit declines of 7.5 percent and 17.3 percent, respectively.
China's air passenger trips rose 13.8 percent year on year in March 2017, picking up pace from the 9.8 percent increase in February, and 11.8 percent for 2016, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
China ranks second in the world in terms of air passenger and cargo, trailing the United States.

SHANGHAI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The maiden flight of the C919, China's first domestically-built large passenger jet, is scheduled for May 5, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) said Wednesday.
The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
"If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said.
The C919, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, signals the country's entry into the global aviation market as a strong competitor, analysts said.
In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line.
"Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight," COMAC said.
The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March.
It has 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China, and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service.

Editor: An
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between Chinese online news service providers and entities with foreign investment should go through a security review, according to a regulation released Tuesday.
The regulation, issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), requires the online news service providers to abide by the law, promote healthy Internet culture and safeguard national and public interest.
The CAC will become the new regulator of online news service, replacing the State Council Information Office.
The service providers should put in place a set of information security protocols and measures, such as reviews, checks and emergency responses regarding online news, the CAC said.
There should be an editor-in-chief for all online news service providers and their staff should be qualified, according to the regulation.
It said that platform operators should protect the privacy of users.
The regulation particularly notes the obligations of online news platform operators, whose services would only be available to users who register with their real identities.
Online news platform operators that violate the regulation will be punished.
In the meantime, another regulation on administrative law-enforcing procedures was also issued by CAC Tuesday, aiming to standardize and safeguard the obligations of online news management departments, so as to properly implement administrative penalties and protect the legal rights of citizens, legal persons and other organizations.
The two regulations will go into force on June 1.

China conditionally approves Dow-DuPont merger

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to greenlight the merger of chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont after nearly a year of antitrust investigations, but asked the two to divest some businesses as preconditions of the approval.
The Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday in a statement that the merger will boost their market shares for some chemicals and limit competition in the Chinese market and beyond.
The two companies' dominance in pesticides, weed killer and several other products will likely increase after the consolidation of their marketing power and R&D division, which will dampen the rise of competitors, negatively impact technological advancement, and hurt downstream dealers.
The ministry believes the post-merger conglomerate will control nearly 40 percent of China's weed killer market, 75 percent for acid copolymers and 100 percent for ionomers. The proportions are similar globally.
Businesses, assets and R&D facilities of those products should be divested, and the new company should ensure supply in reasonable prices in China in the next five years, according to the statement.
The Dow-DuPont merger was also approved by the European Union on similar conditions in March.
In a press release last week, Dow said it plans to start spin-offs within 18 months of the closing of the merger in August, with the Material Science Company the first to be separated.
Announced at the end of 2015, the merger will create a new chemical giant worth up to approximately 130 billion U.S. dollars with three independent, publicly traded companies. Dow and DuPont shareholders will each own about 50 percent of the shares.
Partly buoyed by the merger, Dow's global sales increased 23 percent year on year to 13.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of the year, with China as its fastest-growing market followed by the United States and Europe.
The company highlighted China's role in its business expansion for now and in the future.
"China's transition to a consumption economy focused on domestic growth is progressing on a stable path, with strong growth drivers especially for Dow's products," said Andrew Liveris, Dow's chairman and CEO.

China offers tax incentives for logistics firms

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to encourage the development of the country's logistics industry, China will offer favorable tax terms to lower the cost of commodity storage for logistics firms, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement released Tuesday.
Tax rates on urban land use will be cut by half for logistics facilities that store commodities such as agricultural and mineral products. The term only applies to facilities that cover an area of 6,000 square meters or above, according to the statement.
The tax cut will be in effect from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2019. Companies that already paid the extra will receive credit to be deducted from their taxes payable, according to the statement.
China's logistics industry has been growing steadily thanks to government support that promises lower taxes and costs. In 2016, the gross revenue of the sector hit 7.9 trillion yuan (1.1 trillion U.S. dollars), up 4.6 percent from 2015.
China will encourage more sophisticated development of the logistics sector from 2016 to 2020 to bolster economic growth and deepen supply-side reform, authorities said.

HOUSTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies participated in the 48th Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), which kicked off Monday in Houston.
Although the organizer did not give an exact number of Chinese companies attending this conference, it is a fact that more and more Chinese oil and gas companies have shown their interest in this event.
Leading Chinese companies such as China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petroleum Chemical Corp. attended the event, and the different models of drilling equipment from some Chinese companies are eye-catching.
Jin Xiaojian, president of China Offshore Oil Engineering Co., LTD, told Xinhua that the world offshore oil exploitation is actually a booming industry. Many experts also said that the oil and gas industry is still a sunrise one because oil and gas remains to be the efficient and green energy.
"As an offshore oil and gas explorer, CNOOC is making great efforts to be a world-class enterprise. We can say that after the development over the past three decades, CNOOC is now actually an international level energy company," he said.
Founded in 1969, OTC, the largest event in the world for the oil and gas industry, is where energy professionals meet to exchange ideas and opinions to advance scientific and technical knowledge for offshore resources and environmental matters.
This year's event features more than 300 technical papers from leading upstream firms, more than 60 technical sessions, 24 topical breakfasts and luncheons, along with several in-depth panel discussions. The annual event attracted over 2,300 exhibitors and attendees from 100 countries and regions.
OTC Chairman Joe Fowler said that the conference represents an invaluable platform for new business opportunities and technologies, especially in challenging times.
"OTC is important because it is the best source of technology for new offshore developments," he said.

China main stock index dips on weakening manufacturing data

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese major stock index Shanghai Composite Index edged down Tuesday as a private survey showed that manufacturing activity in China had expanded at a slower pace.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index snapped a four-day winning streak to decline 0.35 percent to 3,143.71 points.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.1 percent lower at 10,223.97 points. The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, ended 0.01 percent higher to close at 1,850.85 points.
Manufacturing activity in China continued to expand in April, although at a slower pace.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released Tuesday stood at 50.3 last month, down from 51.2 in March, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit and sponsored by Caixin Media Co. Ltd.
The stock indexes Tuesday moved within a narrow band on the first trading day after the Labor Day holiday, but shares related to Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, bucked the trend as investors poured money into these shares, said Sun Xiwei, chief investment strategist at CITIC Securities.
Tangshan Jidong Equipment and Engineering surged by the daily limit of 10 percent for the second consecutive trading day to 39.67 yuan (about 5.8 U.S. dollars).
China last month announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, which authorities described as a "major historic and strategic choice" that would be "crucial for the millennium to come," sparking investors' enthusiasm over related stocks.
Sun expected the major indexes to see an uptick in May after a period of fluctuation, boosted by listed companies' upbeat reports for the first quarter and the first half of this year.
Some 60.3 percent of 1,099 Chinese publicly traded companies as of Monday had forecast profit growth or projected that losses would be transferred to gains for the January-June period, Xinhua-run Shanghai Securities News reported Tuesday.

Economic Watch: Weakening manufacturing expansion signals future headwinds

Editor: Yamei
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing activity in China continued to expand in April, although at the slowest pace since last September, after a private survey released Tuesday revealed that an index for the sector fell for the second month.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3 last month, down from 51.2 in March, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit and sponsored by Caixin Media Co. Ltd.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while one below 50 points to contraction.
The weakening trend is in line with the official manufacturing PMI, which came in at 51.2 in April, expanding for the ninth-straight month but also recording a slowdown from 51.8 in March, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The official PMI samples 3,000 manufacturing enterprises in China. The Caixin PMI samples some 500 manufacturers and is relatively volatile due to its small sample size and less involvement of large enterprises.
Caixin attributed the weak expansion to the fact that new orders had increased at the slowest pace since September, while production growth softened for the second month in a row.
The softer growth of total new orders was in accordance with a slowing expansion in new export work due to relatively muted consumer demand abroad, according to the data.
Meanwhile, the Caixin data indicated an ease of cost pressure, with the rate of input price inflation falling to a seven-month low.
"It's not clear whether we have come to a turning point of economic growth, but we do see downward pressure," said Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, a subsidiary of Caixin Insight Group, predicting that the Chinese economy may be starting to embrace a downward trend in the near term.
China has had a strong start this year, with GDP expanding 6.9 percent in the first quarter, well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.
Following the upbeat first-quarter performance, China has received a higher growth forecast for 2017 GDP due to solid growth momentum, but moderation in growth was also expected in the following quarters.
The slower expansion of manufacturing activity echoes the weakening momentum seen in the global economy, evidenced by PMI drops in the United States and Japan since March, said Zhong in a joint report released along with the data.
Zhong was upbeat about the balancing of economic structure, citing the sub-index for small enterprises in the official PMI which rose for two months in a row to near-two-year high in April.
Economists believe that the weakening manufacturing activity was partly the result of mounting pressure from China's strengthened supervision and deleveraging efforts in the financial sector.
A supervisory storm has recently swept the country's financial sector, with regulators showing absolute resolve to fix regulatory loopholes and tighten controls on the real estate sector.
Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities, said the impact of enhancing regulation and property controls on the economy needed to be closely watched, as financial regulations will directly influence the financing of the real economy.
Strengthened regulation would be positive for the economy in the long run, but it could bring "short-term pains," said the CEBM report.
China's official non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54 in April, down from 55.1 in March but still well above the break even point of 50. Caixin has yet to release its service PMI for April.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- State Development & Investment Corp. (SDIC), China's largest state-owned investment holding company, has for the first time issued U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds overseas.
Priced to yield 2.875 percent for the five-year tenor and 3.625 percent for the ten-year tenor, the bonds, worth one billion dollars, were multiple times oversubscribed, with 80 percent of investors from Asia, according to SDIC.
The company called the event a "milestone" for its internationalization.
The issuance will widen financing channels, facilitate overseas investment and acquisitions, and contribute to the Belt and Road Initiative, according to the SDIC.
Global rating agencies, including Moody's and Fitch, assigned the notes high ratings.
SDIC raked in 18 billion yuan (2.61 billion U.S. dollars) of profits in 2016, up 9 percent from a year ago, and its operating revenue stood at 98.4 billion yuan.

Economic Watch: Most Chinese listed companies expected to post hefty profits

Editor: Yamei
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Six in 10 Chinese-listed companies are poised to announce huge profits for the first half of this year, despite concerns that the world's second-largest economy will lose steam.
Some 60.3 percent of 1,099 Chinese publicly traded companies as of Monday had forecast profit growth or projected that losses would be transferred to gains for the January-June period.
The profitability of listed companies offers insight into broader economic performance.
Breakdown figures revealed that only 13.6 percent of these companies are set to witness profit decreases or going into debt for the first six months, and the remainder have not made profit projections, Xinhua-run Shanghai Securities News reported Tuesday.
TRADITIONAL SECTOR WINNERS
As China continues to slash excess capacity and the price of products increases, traditional sectors such as coal, metal and petrochemicals will see continued growth.
Companies in upstream sectors are among the biggest winners, with 54 listed petrochemical companies predicting more profits or reversing business losses. Five companies, including Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical, forecast net profits increases of more than 10-fold year on year.
Nonferrous metal-related companies are expected to turn healthy profits, with 21 businesses expected to announce increased profits or turn losses into profits.
"The prices of petrochemicals and other products remained high at the start of the year due to the ongoing supply-side structural reform and more stringent environmental protection standards. Some smaller companies will be forced to halt business, while industry leaders will secure a stronger foothold in the market," said Chen Hongliang, researcher with Guotai Junan Securities.
China is pressing ahead with supply-side structural reform, which features cutting overcapacity, deleveraging, lowering costs, reducing inventories and strengthening weak business links to generate sustainable long-term growth.
Many electrical equipment manufacturers staged strong growth thanks to robust fixed-asset investment growth in China's transportation infrastructure, with the profits of 12 listed companies set to more than double in the first six months.
SOFTER MOMENTUM
However, some analysts have cautioned that leading economic indicators may ease pace in the coming weeks and Chinese-listed companies will face pressure to achieve their profit targets.
UBS China said Tuesday that April's data is expected to show "slightly softer growth momentum" including weaker industrial production growth, slower property sales and cooler export growth.
The view is echoed by investment bank Nomura, which said that "our composite leading index for China moderated in March, while our heat-map has cooled, pointing to a slower April after a strong March." It forecast China's GDP growth to slow to 6.8 percent in the second quarter from 6.9 percent in Q1.
Both official and private surveys showed that expansion in China's manufacturing sector eased in April.
Commodity prices, including steel and coal, and midstream products, such as chemical fiber, all saw notable corrections in April, partially driven by financial deleveraging, investment firm China International Capital Corp. said.
"The recent decline of raw material prices points to a shift in market supply and demand. Economic growth will witness slightly weaker momentum," said Lian Ping, chief economist at the Bank of Communications.
"It is a crucial moment for some listed companies, especially those smaller ones facing rising debt against the backdrop of the U.S. interest rate increase and rising capital costs at home," said Li Huiyong, economist at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank announced on Tuesday it had pumped more than 590.3 billion yuan (about 85.6 billion U.S. dollars) into the market via multiple tools in April.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it injected 495.5 billion yuan via the medium-term lending facility (MLF) to keep liquidity basically stable.
The MLF operation includes 128 billion yuan that will mature in six months and 367.5 billion yuan that will mature in one year, bringing the total outstanding MLF loans to 4.1 trillion yuan at the end of April.
The interest rates stood at 3.05 percent for the six-month MLF and 3.2 percent for the one-year MLF.
The MLF tool was first introduced in 2014 to help commercial and policy banks maintain liquidity by allowing them to borrow from the central bank by using securities as collateral.
The central bank has increasingly relied on open-market operations for liquidity, rather than cuts in interest rates or reserve requirement ratios to maintain prudent monetary policy.
In addition to the MLF, standing lending facilities (SLF) were also used last month.
A total of 10.89 billion yuan was granted in April to financial institutions via SLF to meet provisional liquidity demand.
In addition, the PBOC injected 83.9 billion yuan through pledged supplementary lending (PSL) to China Development Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China.

GUANGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineers installed a 6,000-ton key structure of the world's longest cross-sea bridge linking Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao.

The wedge, 12-meter-long and weighing more than 25 Airbus A380 jets, was lowered to connect the immersed tubes of the underground tunnel of the bridge, said Lin Ming, chief engineer of the island and tunnel section of the bridge.
The 55-kilometer bridge connects Zhuhai in Guangdong Province with Hong Kong and Macao. It includes a 22.9-km bridge and 6.7-km underground tunnel.
Before the wedge was installed on Tuesday, 33 immersed tubes, each 180 meters long and weighing 80,000 tons, had been installed.
"There is only one wedge for a tunnel, and we cannot afford to fail in its installation. It took two years to prepare for today," said Chen Yue, director of the engineers' office of the bridge's island and tunnel section. The installation procedure took about six hours.
"The margin of error for the wedge is 1.5 centimeters. We have to measure precisely the influence of wind, current and buoyancy force," said Lin.
"It is like putting a needle through a hole -- a truly unprecedented event in the history of transportation," Lin said.
A gigantic crane, which was transformed from a tanker, was used to hoist the wedge, lowering it to the desired destination between the underwater tubes.
The wedge will be welded and finished by June, Lin said.
By the end of the year, the bridge will be open to traffic, said Zhu Yongling, director of the bridge management bureau.
Construction began in December of 2009 at Zhuhai. The Y-shaped bridge starts from Lantau Island in Hong Kong with branches to Zhuhai and Macao.
The bridge will cut travel time from Hong Kong to both Zhuhai and Macao from three hours on the road to a 30-minute drive.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's railway traffic during the International Labor Day holiday rose 6.7 percent year on year, indicating growing enthusiasm for travel among Chinese.
About 49 million passenger trips were made via railway from April 28 to May 1, up 3.09 million from last year, according to the China Railway Corporation.
Traffic peaked on April 29, when about 13.7 million trips were made in a single day, up 5.8 percent year on year while hitting a record high for the International Labor Day holiday.
To accommodate the holiday rush, China Railway Corporation added a total of 1,901 train trips nationwide.
Railway traffic has been rising steadily during China's holidays as interest in travel has increased in the past few years. The country's tourism industry raked in 79.1 billion yuan (11.5 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue during the holiday, up 16.2 percent from a year earlier, official data showed.

Muted coal demand dents China Railway Corp.profit

Editor: An
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China Railway Corp. posted a 34.8 percent profit drop year on year due to decreased freight caused by muted coal demand, a report said Tuesday.
The state-owned railroad operator's total profit stood at 39.65 billion yuan (5.75 billion U.S. dollars) last year, National Business Daily reported, adding that its gross revenue declined by 0.97 percent year on year to 907.45 billion yuan.
"Coal products account for more than half of all railway freight. Any drop in coal demand will impact railway freight revenue significantly," said Zhao Jian, a professor with Beijing Jiaotong University.
The company's freight revenue totaled 257.48 billion yuan in 2016, decreasing for a third year in a row.
In 2016, however, passenger train services contributed more revenue than freight for the first time in three years. Passenger revenue hit 281.75 billion yuan, up 12.4 percent year on year.
As a result, the company's net profit rose to 1.08 billion yuan in 2016, up from 681 million yuan a year before.
China aims to cap coal consumption at 4.1 billion tonnes by 2020 and use cleaner fuel to boost green growth. By 2020, the share of coal in the country's energy mix should fall below 58 percent, according to the energy sector's five-year plan for 2016-2020, released by the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration.
Coal accounted for 64 percent of primary energy in 2015.
The share of non-fossil fuels will rise to more than 15 percent and the share of natural gas should reach 10 percent.
The country's push for cleaner energy is partly a response to smog in northern China, which prompted the government to step up efforts in the war against pollution.
Substances directly related to coal burning are health hazards, including sulfates and soot, major components of PM2.5, airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's top five state-owned banks, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Bank of Communications, posted stable profit growth of 1.68 percent year on year in the first quarter.
Profits of the five banks totaled 267.5 billion yuan (about 38.8 billion U.S dollars) in Q1, official data showed.
ICBC posted profit volume of 75.786 billion yuan, leading all four lenders in amount, while given the profit growth from a year earlier, China Construction Bank led with an increase of 3.03 percent.
Despite slight profit growth on the back of business restructuring, the asset quality of the banks was up in the January-March period. They managed to control bad loan rates, with ICBC's bad loan rate edging down 0.03 percentage points and ABC down 0.04 percentage points compared with the end of last year.
It is also the first time that the gains of China Merchants Bank (CMB), one of the country's biggest joint stock commercial banks, surpassed the Bank of Communication.
The CMB posted Q1 profits totalling 19.977 billion yuan, 654 million yuan higher than Bank of Communications's net profits for the same period.

China central bank suspends reverse repos to drain liquidity

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank suspended open market operations Tuesday, in a sign of policy tightening.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) withdrew 70 billion yuan (around 10 billion U.S. dollars) from the market Tuesday, as reverse repurchase agreements (repos) matured.
Reverse repos is a process by which central banks purchase securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
"There was an increase of fiscal spending at the end of last month and liquidity in the banking system remains at a moderate level. The central bank will not conduct reverse repos Tuesday," according to a statement on the PBOC's website.
The central bank has conducted open market operation reverse repos for nine-consecutive days.
Analysts said such moves reinforced the view that liquidity in the banking system will remain tight in May, as the economy stabilizes in an uncertain environment.
China's GDP expanded 6.9 percent year on year in the first quarter, up from the 6.8-percent growth of the previous quarter and 6.7 percent in 2016.
China has set the tune of its monetary policy in 2017 as prudent and neutral, keeping an appropriate liquidity level but also avoiding excessive liquidity injections.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing activity in China continued to expand in April, though at a slower pace, with a private survey Tuesday showing that an index for the sector had declined from the previous month.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3 last month, down from 51.2 in March, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit and sponsored by Caixin Media Co. Ltd.
Caixin attributed the weak expansion to the fact that new orders had increased at the slowest pace since September 2016. Production growth softened for the second month in a row and rose only marginally overall.
The softer growth of new orders was also in line with a slowing expansion in new export work due to relatively muted consumer demand abroad, according to the data.
Meanwhile, payroll cuts were reported at their fastest since January 2017, signalling a reduction of employees in the manufacturing sector in April, the Caixin data showed.
The data also indicated an ease of cost pressure, with the rate of input price inflation falling to a seven-month low.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below 50 points to contraction.
Official manufacturing PMI came in at 51.2 in April, expanding for the ninth-straight month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China saw a tourism boom during the three-day May Day holiday, a sign of the country's booming tourism industry, official data showed on Monday.
The country's tourism industry raked in 79.1 billion yuan (11.5 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue during the holiday, up 16.2 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the National Tourism Administration.
During the holiday that ended on Monday, tourist destinations across China received a total of 134 million tourists, a year-on-year increase of 14.4 percent.
The tourism boom came as China tries to wean its economy off over-reliance on exports and heavy industries, and shift to a growth model that draws strength from consumption, innovation and service sector.
The tourism industry is considered a driver to growth as it boosts profitability in sectors ranging from hotel, transportation to catering.



Interview: Australia-China fintech links moving forward

CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Two-way trade between Australia and China is being typified by the growth in the financial technology (fintech) sector after Australian start-up Airwallex said it raised 13 million U.S. dollars from backers - including from China - to help fund its business.
The total funding for Airwallex reaches 16 million U.S. dollars as the company had already raised 3 million U.S. dollars in the pre-Series A round last year.
The development, announced by FinTech Australia, will allow Airwallex to enable businesses to make faster, easier and cheaper worldwide payments, and is the latest example of Australian and Chinese cooperation in the fintech sector.
Danielle Szetho, CEO of FinTech Australia - the peak body for fintech in the nation - said recent development in Australian fintech have typified the bilateral trade trends between the two nations.
She said Australia's "thriving" fintech scene is backed by one of most "highly-regarded financial regulatory systems in the world," adding that potential Chinese investors have a lot to gain from taking a closer look at the Australian fintech market.
"This means Australian fintech companies have a great reputation for producing innovative and trusted fintech products in areas such as wealth creation, peer-to-peer lending, payments and cyber security, along with taking advantage of blockchain technology," Szetho said in a statement released on Monday.
"We think that Chinese investors have a lot to gain from taking a close look at the Australian fintech environment and what it has to offer. In addition, we think Chinese consumers and businesses will increasingly get to know the major benefits of Australian fintech products."
She said that a number of thriving Chinee businesses - such as e-commerce giant Alibaba - were expanding their operations into Australia as a result of the local government's willingness to embrace fintech.
"We're also excited to see that Chinese fintech firms are also beginning to establish bases in Australia, given Australia's world record for uninterrupted economic growth and the long-standing cultural links between the two countries," Szetho said.
"As a market well known for its early adoption of technology and 'fintech-friendly by design' regulation, Australia also represents a great test market for new Chinese fintechs looking to expand into western markets.
"Australia has a relatively small venture capital market by world standards, which provides an attractive and new opportunity for inbound Chinese investment."
Australia is best known for its resources exports to China and there is no reason why it shouldn't be able to also export some of its trusted and innovative fintech product, according to Szetho.
However it's not just Chinese backers which are moving to Australia or funding Australian start-ups; Australian fintechs such as CrowdfundUP and Novatti are also actively pursuing big moves into the Chinese market.
Novatti is an alternative mobile payment platform which enables Australians to accept payments from Chinese apps such as WeChat and AliPay, and has recently launched a subsidiary called China Payments, which it hopes will flourish in the Chinese market.
Novatti CEO Peter Cook said China provides a "huge opportunity" for his business to expand.
"Our China Payments subsidiary is actively involved in promoting new types of wallets from China for cross border transactions that help drive sales for Australian exporters and retail stores," Cook said on Monday.
"These new types of overseas wallets are allowing a lot more innovation and margin control, innovation and flexibility."
He said China Payments has noticed with its merchants that they quickly gain new consumers and businesses from China once they bring on these new payment methods.
"China Payments is actively helping financial institutions in Australia deploy some of these services, helping innovation and growing businesses."
Meanwhile CrowdfundUP Managing Director, Jack Quigley said his company was "actively pursuing" opportunities to "tap into" China's massive population, by using the "landing pad" established by the Australian government through the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.
"We have strong partnerships with Chinese businesses underway as we believe collaboration with the local players is the best way to learn the intricacies of the market," Quigley said.
"China is a major player in the global fintech landscape and we've found they are just as excited by the prospect of learning more about Australia's sophisticated financial services sector."
The world's largest e-commerce retailer, Alibaba, opened its Australian headquarters in February, and teamed up with Australia Post to fight counterfeit food fraud, while a trade mission involving eight Australian fintech companies visited China in March.

China Focus: Listed firms post robust profit growth thanks to improving economy

Editor: xuxin
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The total net profit of publicly traded Chinese firms rose 11.22 percent in 2007, boosted by an improving economy.
Every listed firm on the A-share markets but one had released their financial results for 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 by Sunday.
Total revenue of the 3,204 listed firms reached 32.51 trillion yuan (4.72 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2016, up 10.21 percent year on year, compared with just 1.13 percent year-on-year growth in 2015.
About 70 percent of the listed firms reported net profit growth for 2016, with 620 having more than doubling net profits.
Firms in upstream sectors such as coal and steel were big winners. The steel sector suffered losses in Q1 2016, but turned to profit in the following three quarters.
The government launched a campaign of supply-side reform last year to cut excess capacity in steel and coal, leading to rising prices that helped boost financial performance.
However, listed firms in machinery, fossil fuels and finance reported slower profit growth in 2016.
The Chinese economy expanded 6.7 percent in 2016, the slowest growth rate in over a quarter of a century. It grew 6.9 percent in Q1, well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.
Financial statements showed that net profit of listed firms grew 19.8 percent in Q1, adding to signs that the world's second largest economy is firming up.
China's major industrial firms reported a 23.8-percent year-on-year profit growth last month, slowing from 31.5 percent in January and February but much faster than the 8.5-percent increase in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
However, it is not known if the strong growth momentum can be sustained, as China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities both softened expansion in April.
The manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 51.2 in April, lower than the 51.8 recorded in March, while the index for non-manufacturing stood at 54, down from 55.1 in March.
Commodity prices such as steel, coal, as well as midstream products such as chemical fiber all saw notable corrections in April, partially driven by financial deleveraging, said investment firm China International Capital Corporation (CICC) in a research note.
China has recently stepped up efforts to contain asset bubbles and financial risks, including real estate controls in some cities, as a stabilizing economy provides more room for tightened policies.
Improving efficiency of supply is a sustainable way for enterprises to make profit and it is imperative to stick to deleveraging and give up on government bail-outs, according to Jiang Chao, chief economist with Haitong Securities.
"China should deleverage its economy at a proper pace to ensure the financial sector is under pressure to keep reducing leverage while avoiding being pushed into any systemic financial risks," Xu Zhong, head of the research bureau of the People's Bank of China, wrote in the latest edition of Caijing Magazine.
Overly fast deleveraging might lead to shrinking credit and deflation, hurting the real economy, according to Xu.
Although the market has been concerned about the potential spill-over to real economic growth from ongoing regulatory tightening, April monetary data may indicate improved policy coordination and an overall moderate pace of monetary tapering relative to the strength of the economy, the CICC note said.

BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China should deleverage its economy at a proper pace to ensure the financial sector is under pressure to keep reducing leverage while avoiding being pushed into any systemic financial risks, according to a senior central bank official.
"China's overall leverage level is reasonable but is rising at an alarming pace, especially in the financial sector," Xu Zhong, head of the research bureau of the People's Bank of China, wrote in the latest edition of Caijing Magazine.
Xu pointed out that government over-stimulus and poor corporate management and financial supervision were key factors leading to the rising leverage ratio.
He said that to effectively address the challenge, the government should play down the importance of the GDP growth target to avoid massive short-term stimulus, and stick to prudent and neutral monetary policy while rationalizing fiscal responsibilities between central and local government.
Meanwhile, enterprises, especially state-owned, should make more market-oriented reforms to improve corporate governance and financial performance.
He said China should continue to reform its financial regulatory framework to deal with cross-sector issues and to avoid always leaving the central bank to clean up the mess.
"Financial security is achieved via reforms, not bail-outs," Xu said.

China's major banks see slowing profit growth, falling bad loan rates in Q1

BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China's major banks saw slowing profit growth in the first quarter, though bad loan rates fell.
Financial statements from China's five major banks, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and China Construction Bank, showed slowing profit growth in Q1, with the first three banks seeing net profits plunge by over 70 percent compared with the previous quarter.
China's largest bank by capitalization ICBC raked in net profit of 76 billion yuan (11.03 billion U.S. dollars) in the Jan.-March period, up 1.5 percent year on year.
Despite falling profit growth, they managed to keep bad loan rates from rising, with ABC's bad loan rate edging down 0.04 percent and ICBC down 0.03 percent compared with the previous quarter.
Analysts attributed the slowing profit growth to economic slowdown, and believe the country's debt-for-equity swap policies and enhanced government regulation helped improve their bad loan management performance.
China released a detailed plan last October, allowing banks to exchange bad debt for stocks in companies concerned, which will help free up bank balance sheets.

SEOUL, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai Motor, South Korea's biggest automaker, has selected Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) as its first battery supplier in China to enhance cooperation in new energy vehicles.
"We selected CATL as our first Chinese battery partner as Hyundai seeks to diversify its supplier base," a Hyundai official who declined to be identified told Xinhua Monday.
The official said CATL was widely recognized for its competitiveness in the automobile battery market.
The Fujian Province-based company will provide batteries for Hyundai's plug-in Sonata sedans that are expected to hit the Chinese market in the first half of 2018.
The Sonata plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) models would have both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.
Beijing Hyundai Motor, Hyundai's Chinese venture, said at the Shanghai auto show in April that it would introduce six new energy vehicles in China within a short period of time beginning with an electric variant sedan model in the latter half of this year.
The CATL is supplying automobile batteries to renowned carmakers and Chinese brands. It plans to start operation of a new factory in east China's Jiangsu Province next year.
It is forecast to increase its battery output capacity six-fold by 2020 to 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's manufacturing sector expanded for the ninth straight month in April, but the pace has slowed as authorities stepped up efforts to contain financial risks.
The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.2 in April, lower than the 51.8 recorded in March, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The reading fell short of market expectations but still stayed above the boom-bust line of 50.
"As policymakers shift their emphasis to address financial risks, it will inevitably have an impact on liquidity, financing costs and growth expectations," said Zhang Yiping, a researcher at China Merchants Securities.
China has had a strong start this year, with GDP expanding 6.9 percent in the first quarter, well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.
The industrial sector posted 28.3-percent year-on-year profit growth in Q1, adding to signs of a stabilizing economy.
The PMI data released Sunday indicated that pressure remains on growth in the second quarter.
The sub-index for production stood at 53.8 in April while the sub-index for new orders came in at 52.3, both down from a month ago. The low growth was a result of contraction in high energy consumption industries, lower prices at factory gates, and slower expansion in both imports and exports, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.
"While both the production and new orders indices are still positive, the gap between them has widened, which needs to be closely watched," he said.
Commodities prices such as steel, coal, as well as midstream products such as chemical fiber have all seen a notable corrections in April, partially driven by financial deleveraging, said investment firm China International Capital Corporation (CICC) in a research note.
China has recently stepped up efforts to contain asset bubbles and financial risks, including real estate controls in some cities, as a stabilizing economy provides more room for tightened policies.
Monetary conditions also tightened more visibly, with the central bank steering clear of interest rate cuts and avoiding tinkering with reserve requirement ratios over the past year. Instead, it employed a range of tools, such as reverse repos and lending facilities to manage liquidity.
"Although the ongoing monetary tapering and regulatory tightening may reduce the 'excess' built-up in highly leveraged financial products, the tightening effect is unlikely to become restrictive to economic growth," according to CICC.
Sunday's data also showed that China's non-manufacturing sector continued to expand in April at slower pace, with the index standing at 54, down from 55.1 in March.
Tepid growth in the manufacturing sector weighed on the index, dragging down growth in manufacturing-related service industries, according to Zhao.
While both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices showing signs of ebbing, the breakdown of the data pointed to the better economic structure that China desires.
The sub-index for consumer goods manufacturing, for example, continued upward to reach 52.2 in April.
"This indicates that consumer demand is still stable, and consumption will still be a key to economic growth this year," said Zhang.

CHANGCHUN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's oldest automaker FAW will have 32 distributors in Russia by the end of this year, said the company on Sunday.
Currently the group has 22 distributors in Russia, selling Vita V2 and V5, as well as Besturn B50. It recently launched its first SUV in Russia, the Besturn X80.
Wang Zhijian, president of the FAW Group Import and Export Co. Ltd believes that the launch could push up sales and attract more distributors.
"Russia has always been FAW's strategic market," he said. "The launch of Besturn X80 will enhance the influence of FAW brands in Russia."
FAW began talks with Russian auto manufacturer Avtoto in 2015 for local assembly. Besturn X80 is also FAW's first auto assembled in Russia.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's non-manufacturing sector continued to expand in April, though at a slower pace compared with a month ago, official data showed Sunday.
The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 54 in April, down from 55.1 in March, according to the the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The reading above 50 suggests continuing strength in the country's non-manufacturing sector, though the growth pace has slowed, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.
The service sector, which accounts for more than half of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) last year, slowed its growth pace in April.
The index for commercial activities in the service industry came in at 52.6, down from 54.2 registered in March.
Notably, the index for new orders in the service sector fell below the boom-bust line of 50 to 49.7, indicating sluggish market demand.
A slower expansion in manufacturing-related service sector was the main reason behind the tepid growth, according to Zhao.
China's manufacturing sector saw its expansion slowed in April, with the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) falling to 51.2 from 51.8 in March, according to NBS data.
Still, service industries including retail, railway and airline transport, and courier services reported faster growth, with the sub-indices standing above 55.
Activities in construction industry was also robust as demand for infrastructure kept rising this year, according to Zhao. The sub-index for construction commercial activities came in at 61.6, well above the boom-bust line of 50.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in April, though at a slower pace, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.2 in April, lower than the 51.8 recorded in March, according to NBS data.
The reading fell short of market expectations but still stayed above the boom-bust line of 50 for the ninth straight month.
The slower expansion was in part due to sluggish growth in both market demand and supply, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.
The sub-index for production stood at 53.8 in April while the sub-index for new orders came in at 52.3, both down from the level a month ago.
"While both the production and the new orders indices are still in the expansion territory, the gap between them has widened, which needs to be closely watched," Zhao said.
The lower-than-expected expansion was also a result of contraction in the high energy-consuming industries, lower price at factory gate, and slower expansion in both imports and exports, Zhao said.
On a positive note, equipment manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing continued robust growth, with the sub-indices coming in at 52.1 and 53.4 respectively, well above the 51.2 registered for all manufacturing industries.
Consumer goods manufacturing also rose to 52.2, indicating an increasingly important role it plays in the economy, Zhao said.

The factory, with an area of 10,000 square meters, is in Quanzhou, Fujian Province. Built in June 2016, the land is designed to be a "plant factory," where all environmental factors, including light, humidity, temperature and gases, can be controlled to produce quality vegetables.
The method is pursued by Sananbio, a joint venture between the Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IBCAS) and Sanan Group, a Chinese optoelectronics giant. The company is attempting to produce more crops in less space while minimizing environmental damage.
Sananbio said it would invest 7 billion yuan (about 1.02 billion U.S. dollars) to bring the new breed of agriculture to reality.
NEW FARMING
Plant factories, also known as a vertical farms, are part of a new global industry.
China now has about 80 plant factories, and Sananbio has touted its Quanzhou facility as the world's largest plant factory.
In the factory, leafy greens grow in six stacked layers with two lines of blue and red LED lights hung above each layer. The plants are grown using hydroponics, a method that uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead of soil.
"Unlike traditional farming, we can control the duration of lighting and the component of mineral solutions to bring a higher yield," said Pei Kequan, a researcher with IBCAS and director of R&D in Sanabio. "The new method yields ten-times more crops per square meter than traditional farming."
From seedling to harvesting, vegetables in the farm usually take 35 days, about 10 days shorter than greenhouse plants.
To achieve a higher yield, scientists have developed an algorithm which automates the color and duration of light best for plant growth, as well as different mineral solutions suitable for different growth stages.
The plant factory produces 1.5 tonnes of vegetables every day, most of which are sold to supermarkets and restaurants in Quanzhou and nearby cities.
The world's population will bloat to 9.7 billion by 2050, when 70 percent of people will reside in urban areas, according to the World Health Organization.
Pei said he believes the plant factory can be part of a solution for potential future food crises.
In the factory, he has even brought vertical farming into a deserted shipping container.
"Even if we had to move underground someday, the plant factory could help ensure a steady supply of vegetables," he said.
HEALTHIER FUTURE
Before entering the factory, Sananbio staff have to go through strict cleanroom procedures: putting on face masks, gloves, boots, and overalls, taking air showers, and putting personal belongings through an ultraviolet sterilizer.
The company aims to prevent any external hazards that could threaten the plants, which receive no fertilizers or pesticides.
By adjusting the mineral solution, scientists are able to produce vegetables rich or low in certain nutrients.
The factory has already been churning out low-potassium lettuces, which are good for people with kidney problems.
Adding to the 20 types of leafy greens already grown in the factory, the scientists are experimenting on growing herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine and other healthcare products.
Zheng Yanhai, a researcher at Sananbio, studies anoectohilus formosanus, a rare herb in eastern China with many health benefits.
"In the plant factory, we can produce the plants with almost the same nutrients as wild anoectohilus," Zheng said. "We tested different light, humidity, temperature, gases and mineral solutions to form a perfect recipe for the plant."
The factory will start with rare herbs first and then focus on other health care products, Zheng said.
GROWING PAINS
Currently, most of the products in the plant factory are short-stemmed leafy greens.
"Work is in progress to bring more varieties to the factory," said Li Dongfang, an IBCAS researcher and Sananbio employee.
Some are concerned about the energy consumed with LED lights and air-conditioning.
"Currently, it takes about 10 kwh of electricity to produce one kilogram of vegetables," said Pei, who added that the number is expected to drop in three to five years, with higher LED luminous efficiency.
In a Yonghui superstore in neighboring Xiamen city, the vegetables from the plant factory have a specially designated area, and are sold at about a 30 percent premium, slightly higher than organic and locally produced food.
"Lettuce from the plant factory is a bit expensive, at least for now, there are many other healthy options," said Wang Yuefeng, a consumer browsing through the products, which are next to the counter for locally produced food.
Sananbio said it plans to expand the factory further to drive down the cost in the next six months. "The price will not be a problem in the future, with people's improving living standards," Li said.

JINAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's leading new energy vehicle maker BYD will set up a monorail train production base and launch a tourist monorail line in east China's Shandong Province.
According to an agreement recently signed between BYD and the government of Jining city, the 35-km-long cloud rail connects Qufu, the hometown of Confucius with Zoucheng, the birthplace of Mencius.
Confucius and Mencius were both Chinese thinkers more than 2,000 years ago.
The total investment for the first phase is 8 billion yuan (1.16 billion U.S. dollars). The rail, or called Yungui, will be completed in September next year.
Monorail trains can run at a maximum speed of 80 km per hour. Compared with subways, overground monorail costs less and is less noisy.
The Qufu-Zoucheng monorail will be convenient for tourists and residents to travel between the two cities, said Feng Jialei, head of the Jining Investment Promotion Bureau.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Poly Real Estate Group, one of China's leading real estate companies, reported 38.73 percent year-on-year growth in its first-quarter net profits despite tightening government regulation on the property market.
The Beijing-based company said in a report filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange Saturday that it reaped 1.89 billion yuan (about 270 million U.S. dollars) in net profits in the first three months, but its business revenue dropped 5.14 percent to 17.9 billion yuan. Earnings per share rose to 0.16 yuan from 0.13 yuan a year ago.
Chinese property developers enjoyed a bumper year in 2016 due to strong sales and easing monetary policies, but runaway housing prices have prompted government cooling measures from October last year.
Dozens of cities have implemented tougher cooling measures to limit price gains since mid-March, following Beijing's unprecedentedly strict curbs that lifted the downpayment ratio for second homes to 60 percent.
Poly said that as the government made further strides in market regulation, property markets in cities with tough price curbs would be impacted
Of 70 large and medium-sized cities monitored by the government, 24 witnessed slower price rise year on year in March, up from 20 in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Shares of the Poly Real Estate Group dropped 1.36 percent to 9.42 yuan on the Shanghai market Friday.

China's consumer price growth likely to accelerate in April

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer inflation is expected to pick up in April due to rising non-food prices and a low base for the same period a year ago, according to a report of the Bank of Communications.
The bank forecast the official consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, will have grown 1.1 percent year-on-year for this month, slightly faster than March's 0.9-percent growth and the 0.8-percent increase in February.
Price hikes in refined oil products have become a significant support for non-food prices, which will likely rose 2.4 percent from a year ago, and a stronger carry-over effect also helped push up the CPI.
But prices of vegetables, eggs, poultry and other major farm produce continued to decrease in the first three weeks of April. Food prices account for nearly one-third of prices used in calculating the CPI.
The official CPI is due to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics on May 10.
The bank predicts rising prices in the middle of the year but dismissed inflationary pressures for the whole 2017 because of subdued consumer demand, and prudent and neutral monetary policy.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market regulator approved 10 IPO applications in the past week.
The companies will be allowed to raise up to 5.8 billion yuan (about 840 million U.S. dollars), according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
Five companies will be listed on the Shanghai bourse, two on the Shenzhen small and medium-enterprise board, and three on the ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board.
The 10 firms and their underwriters will confirm IPO dates and publish prospectuses following discussions with the exchanges.
Under the current IPO system, new shares are subject to approval from the commission, which controls both timing and price.
China is working on transforming its IPO approval system into one based on registration, allowing the bourses to take over approvals and clear the backlog of companies waiting.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China Southern Airlines, the country's biggest carrier by passenger volume, said Saturday its net profits slumped 42.44 percent year on year to 1.55 billion yuan (about 220 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of 2017.
In a report filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the airline attributed its profit drop to rising global fuel prices in the three-month period.
The company's business revenue rose 10.58 percent from the same period last year to 30.97 billion yuan in the first quarter, according to the report. Earnings per share stood at 0.16 yuan.
Share price of the airline dropped 0.52 percent to 7.7 yuan on the Shanghai market Friday.
The Guangzhou-based state-owned operator announced in late March that American Airlines would spend 200 million U.S. dollars to buy a stake in the company, which is pushing progress in its mixed-ownership reform.

Xinhua Insight: Belt and Road Initiative boosts China's e-commerce

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Even in his wildest dreams, Wu Zhen never expected to run a business with annual sales of 100 million yuan (about 14.5 million U.S. dollars) when he started his cross-border online store in 2015.
But two years later, his maternity childcare shop on Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com has gone beyond his expectations. The U.S.-based online store has easily achieved its first-quarter sales target, and Wu is confident of promising full-year results.
Wu used to do domestic business in China, but sales volumes were not comparable with his cross-border business.
He realized that his growing business was closely related to the Belt and Road Initiative, a China-proposed transnational network of trade, investment and economic development.
Wu and his colleagues make purchases from the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and then send them to bonded areas in China for stocking.
"There were only two bonded warehouses serving JD.com's cross-border e-commerce in 2015, and now there are seven," Wu said.
JD.com has noticed the vast opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative, which is expected to include more than 60 percent of the world's population and more than one-third of global economic output.
By 2016, JD.com opened 256 major warehouses across the country, covering most of the domestic key cities along the Belt and Road Initiative, including Shanghai, Xi'an and Chengdu.
According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, cross-border e-commerce turnover in China has grown by about 30 percent a year from 2008 to 2015. In 2016, total turnover reached 6.3 trillion yuan.
Instead of preparing shipments after receiving orders, robust sales allow retailers to keep sufficient inventory in domestic warehouses, so that customers do not have to spend weeks waiting for goods to be shipped overseas.
For retailers like Wu, the Belt and Road Initiative has made shipping across continents easier.
Using the China-Europe rail network, a crucial part of the Belt and Road Initiative, JD.com has cut the time transporting auto supplies from Germany to southwest China by half compared with sea routes. It now takes just two weeks.
China now has express freight services to 28 European cities. Since March 2011, more than 3,500 trips have been made, and the figure should rise to 5,000 by 2020.
"We are confident of the logistics system," said Qi Ting, JD Worldwide General Manager.
The further opening up to overseas markets has brought the number of product brands available at JD Worldwide Service to over 20,000, covering more than 70 countries and regions, according to Qi.
"They range from food and body care to home appliance and auto supplies," Qi said, revealing that JD Worldwide Service outperformed all other departments of JD.com, with three-digit growth, last year.
"It has become a lifestyle for more Chinese people to buy overseas products online," she said.
Besides traditionally popular exporters such as Europe and the United States, Chinese e-commerce has seen growing interest in products from Belt and Road countries, such as pillows and rice from Thailand, and electronics from Israel.
According to a report jointly issued by DT Caijing and AliResearch, the research arm of Alibaba Group, one of JD.com's major domestic rivals, in 2016, nearly 280,000 latex pillows from Thailand were sold through Alibaba's cross-border retailing site Tmall Global.
The sales volume of Thai products at Tmall Global jumped 152 percent year on year in 2016. The huge demand of latex pillow from China has even driven up natural rubber prices by three to four times in Thailand, a strong lift for local farmers' income, the report said.
"We are also looking into products from western Asia, as well as eastern and central Europe," Qi said.
She said her company was actively seeking cooperation with a dozen brands from Belt and Road countries in accordance with domestic consumer demand.
In the next five years, JD.com is planning to open more than 20 overseas warehouses to store and transfer goods from over 100 countries and regions including those along the Belt and Road Initiative. It has already taken a further step into the Belt and Road market by starting an e-commerce business in Indonesia.
By 2020, trade volume through cross-border e-commerce will account for 37.6 percent of China's total exports and imports, making it a significant part of China's foreign trade, research agency CI Consulting predicted.
Cross-border e-commerce cooperation has brought China and Belt and Road countries closer, and the benefits will extend not only to trade, but also to sectors such as the Internet and e-commerce, said the DT Caijing-AliResearch report.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The first freight train traveling from Britain back to China reached its destination in eastern China's Yiwu city on Saturday after a 19 day journey, according to the China Railway Corporation (CRC).
The trans-continental freight train, loaded with 32 containers, mainly carrying maternity products and soft drinks, departed from London on April 10.
Having traveled more than 12,000 kilometers, it passed through seven countries before reaching the Chinese manufacturing and trade hub where small goods such as homeware, garments and souvenirs are made.
London is the 15th city in Europe added to China-Europe freight train services. The first Chinese freight train arrived in London in January.
The China-Britain freight service paves a safe and efficient trade route by land, strengthening bilateral trade ties and better serving the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, according to the CRC.
China now has express freight services to 28 European cities. Since March 2011, more than 3,500 trips have been made. The figure should rise to 5,000 by 2020.




Across China: Foreign-related legal services booming

CHENGDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yuhong knows he was right when he gave up his dentistry major and became a lawyer more than a decade ago.
Despite holding a master's degree in dental sciences, Wu went to the United States for a law degree and worked as a lawyer there for more than a year.
In 2008, he returned home to Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, driven by his belief that legal services would soon see a golden age in China.
"With foreign investment flowing in and domestic businesses expanding out, more international lawyers will be needed," he recalled.
As China opens its door wider to the world, legal services dealing with foreign-related matters are witnessing a growing market nationwide, especially in the previously less-developed western China.
Over the past three years, the Deheng law firm in Chengdu, where Wu works, saw foreign-related cases jump from 30 to 80 percent of their total.
The range of cases has also broadened from labor, tax and intellectual property issues to cross-border acquisition, foreign listings and overseas projects by Chinese companies, said Wu.
He said clients have done business in Pakistan, Brazil, Tanzania and Kenya, with the largest case worth about 1.75 billion U.S. dollars.
China has more than 300,000 licensed lawyers, and in Chengdu, a city of 14 million, the number of lawyers exceeds 10,000.
Compared to coastal areas, foreign-related legal services inland had lagged behind until recent years.
"Before our firm was established, one of my clients had to turn to law firms in Shanghai, Hong Kong and, subsequently, Britain to find a proper lawyer for a case in 2007," Wu said, adding legal services for the case cost the client about 900,000 U.S. dollars.
In January, the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council jointly issued a circular calling for better legal services for overseas projects and those "going global."
The circular proposed that by 2020, there should be a team of legal personnel in China with knowledge of international rules and a number of quality legal institutions.
Against the backdrop of major national development strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative, overseas legal service providers should help guard against investment risks in transportation, energy, communication and other infrastructure projects, it said.
Yuan Zongyong, head of the Chengdu justice bureau, said legal services related to foreign affairs not only help protect the interests of Chinese companies in international business, but are also advantageous for optimizing the foreign investment environment.
Yuan said the Belt and Road Initiative will bring a new round of foreign investment to the city and opportunities for foreign-related legal services along with it.
"Interdisciplinary talent with a good command of economics, technology, foreign languages and law is badly needed, especially people who are good at Arabic and law in Muslim countries," he said.
Chengdu is promoting creation of an alliance and a secretariat among 600 law firms along the Belt and Road to provide better legal services in the region, according to Yuan.
"We hope all those who run foreign companies can find lawyers who speak their native languages in Chengdu, and those here at home can have a proper legal service provider to guide their direction in going overseas," he said.

Chinese financial regulators vow stricter supervision

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial regulators have vowed stricter supervision to prevent systemic risks as the importance of financial security grows amid a firming economy.
The top insurance regulator on Friday announced a targeted campaign to crack down on violations and restore market order, with measures against false capital contribution, chaotic corporate governance, irregular investment and fake data.
Supervisors should earnestly take responsibility and act hard against illegal and criminal activities, said a statement of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
The CIRC pledged more efforts to find loopholes and fix shortcomings in supervision.
Meanwhile, the banking regulator said on its website that it will closely monitor risks in key areas and promised solid implementation of risk control. De-leveraging and improving weak areas were also highlighted in the statement.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said it will implement more coordinated supervision and take actions against violations in the forex market.
The announcements suggested Chinese authorities are taking concrete measures to address financial risks and curb asset bubbles as a stabilizing economy provides more room for tightened policies.
China's policymakers agreed on Tuesday in a high-level meeting that more efforts should be made to maintain financial security in the face of risks and challenges including external shocks.
Risk prevention and supervision must be improved to avoid neglecting any risks or hidden trouble, according to the meeting.
The insurance regulator also vowed to improve the conduct of officials as China's top anti-graft authority said earlier this month that the CIRC head was removed from his post and put under investigation.
Having learned bitter lessons, the CIRC will persevere in remaining free of corruption.
Xiang Junbo, chairman of the CIRC, is being investigated on suspicion of a serious violation of the code of conduct of the Communist Party of China.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Alibaba's four-year-oldspider Yu'e Bao surpassed JPMorgan's U.S. government money market fund to become the world's largest, according to the Financial Times.
With 165.6 billion U.S. dollars under management, the Yu'e Bao fund has grown rapidly, reflecting the increasing importance and irreplaceable role of technology and e-commerce in China.
The payments affiliate company of Alibaba, Ant Financial Services Group found that a great deal of cash remains in customers' accounts, which could be used for a fund. The Yu'e Bao fund was therefore born in 2013 and swept the money in those accounts into it.
Due to Yu'e Bao's expansion, Tianhong Fund Management, the co-founder of Yu'e Bao has become the first fund company to break one trillion yuan (about 145 billion U.S. dollars). Moreover, Yu'e Bao's custodian bank CITIC Bank has also become the largest fund custody institution.
Peter Alexander, managing director of China consultancy Z-Ben Advisors commented that Yu'e Bao has "so many individual accounts they are able to have the power to negotiate with banks, and because the duration is very short, they also have high liquidity."
The large scale of the Yu'e Bao fund allowed it to "negotiate better rates, and banks need deposits to lend, and these are deposits," Alexander was quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
An analyst at Tianhong Fund Management said that their company gives top priority to the liquidity of capital flows, but they also take every measure to balance the yield rate, liquidity and financial risks.
"Yu'e Bao's large scale of capital brings challenge for investment, research and risk management," said Wang Dengfeng, a fund manager of Yu'e Bao. "On one hand, the fund holders have diverse demands, on the other hand, huge assets bring bigger pressure."

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's cultural industry saw rapid revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017 driven partly by booming cultural services, official data showed Friday.
The sector's combined revenue amounted to 1.99 trillion yuan (about 289 billion U.S. dollars), up 11 percent year on year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
In 2016, the growth rate was 8.6 percent for Q1 and 7.5 percent for the whole year.
The NBS tracks around 52,000 companies across 10 cultural sectors -- six in services and four in manufacturing.
Revenue from information transmission services increased the most, by 29.4 percent year on year, followed by 16.8 percent for entertainment services and 15.8 percent for artistic services.
The more developed eastern region contributed 74.4 percent of the total revenue, no change from last year.

Economic Watch: Upbeat sentiment at China trade fair bodes well for economy

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Standing in front of a refrigerator, buyers attending China's largest trade fair are intrigued by the display of their body weights on the screen of the machine.
The refrigerator, designed and manufactured by China's home appliance maker Midea Group, uses infrared scanning technology to provide users with health data, and offers them tailored diet suggestions.
There are many similar smart home appliances at the ongoing China Import and Export Fair in the southern city of Guangzhou. Wifi-enabled washing machines, pots that cook on their own -- innovations like these are Chinese manufacturers' answer to changing customer demand.
The bi-annual event bringing together tens of thousand of buyers and producers worldwide is considered a barometer for China's foreign trade, which has been under significant pressure as global demand waned.
But as companies like Midea have maintained innovative tactics to adapt to changes in the global market, China's foreign trade has gradually struggled out of the mire and turned out to be a key support for growth.
The teeming crowd and optimistic mood at this year's fair once again proved the resilience of Chinese exporters and hence the world's second largest economy.
Official data showed China's foreign trade saw robust growth in Q1 to reach 6.2 trillion yuan (about 899 billion U.S. dollars) in volume, up 21.8 percent year on year.
The strong performance helped the broader economy onto a steadier track, which expanded 6.9 percent in the first three months, up from 6.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Net exports of goods and services contributed 4.2 percent of growth in Q1, compared with the 11.5-percent negative contribution in the same period last year.
In the new global reality that seems to be tilting towards protectionism and anti-globalization, trade growth is hard won and largely due to the innovative spirit of the country's myriad medium and small firms.
In recent years, rising material and labor costs have forced Chinese manufacturers to speed up efforts to move up the value chain to survive fierce competition, spawning a new generation of exporters engaged in production of high-tech and high value added products.
"Chinese companies should target market demand and trends to produce high-quality, differentiated and environment friendly products to push the transformation and upgrading of foreign trade," Vice Commerce Minister Fang Aiqing said.
And with China's deeper engagement with other countries, companies are seeking new opportunities in the global market. The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by China in 2013, is one strategy in which businesses see huge potential.
At the Canton Fair, almost half of invited buyers are from countries and regions along the Belt and Road
Goods trade between China and Belt and Road countries surged 26.2 percent year on year to more than 1.65 trillion yuan in the first quarter of this year, data from the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) showed.
Li Xiaochuan, general manager of Shenzhen-based kitchenware exporter Liantek Electrical Appliances, said demand from countries along the Belt and Road, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, had been rising rapidly.
"Besides buying our products, foreign buyers in these countries also hope that we could build factories and production bases there. We will start on that next year," Li said.
"It is an inevitable trend for Chinese companies to invest overseas while exporting goods," said Bai Ming, vice director of a research institute under the MOC. "Cooperation in trade and investment will help Chinese industries move up the global value chain."

SAN FRANCISCO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Midea Group, a Chinese electrical appliance manufacturer, launched Thursday a technology center in Silicon Valley of the United States as part of an effort to turn itself into a technology company.
Listed on the Fortune Global in 2016, Midea is a household name in China but more an original equipment manufacturer making an vast array of air treatment, kitchen, laundry, cooking, refrigeration and other appliances for other companies in the rest of the world.
Known as Midea Emerging Technology Center (ETC), the new facility with more than 930 square meters of floor space in San Jose, California and an initial annual budget of 100 million yuan (15 million U.S. dollars), is the company's second of its kind in the United States, after Midea America Research Center in Louisville, Kentucky.
At the inaugural ceremony, Zachary Hu, senior vice president and chief technology officer, said the center will focus on developing artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor technologies, with a goal to bring their applications into Midea product lines.
Hu said it is the talent pool that matters most for the company, acknowledging that it has been a "frog leap" for Midea, a maker of small kitchen appliances, to enter new areas such as AI and robotics with its recent acquisition of Kuka AG in Germany, a supplier of intelligent robotics and automation solutions.
Wang Dongyan, vice president and general manager of the ETC, is arguably a Silicon Valley veteran with work experience with a number of international technology companies. Midea is the first Chinese company he has ever worked for.

Chinese aerospace companies seek to explore LatAm market

MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese aerospace companies have been increasing their participation in the global market and their next destination is Latin America.
During the ongoing Mexico Aerospace Fair held at the Santa Lucia Air Base close to the Mexican capital, Chinese companies participated in the event for the first time with their advanced technologies and equipment.
Entering the main venue of the fair, visitors and participants can see a model of the second generation of Wing-Loong, China-developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which had just had a successful maiden flight in the spring in 2017.
The Wing-Loong II marks China's new generation of UAV, which combines the dual capabilities of reconnaissance and strike, said Liu Yu, vice president of China National Aero-technology Import and Export Corporation, an affiliate of state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
"Taking consideration of the great demand of UAVs in Mexico and the whole Latin American region, we have brought with us to the exhibition unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), which are gaining a reputation at home and abroad with products such as the Wing-Loong series," said Liu.
"Our main purpose here is to showcase China's advanced technology and products to clients from potential market of Latin America," said Pan Zhenggang, deputy president of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC).
The booming aerospace and defence industry in Latin America has provided great opportunities for companies worldwide.
Taking Mexico for example, Mexico has become a major supplier nation of aerospace products and the third largest destination of foreign direct investment in the aerospace and defense industry next to the U.S. and the U.K., said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the opening ceremony of the fair on Wednesday.
Although it is the first time for Chinese companies to participate in the fair, they attached great importance to the Latin American market as their products were carefully selected to cater the needs of customers in the strategic region.
The Wing-Loong UAV can endure harsh and adverse conditions, such as scorching deserts, highland gales, high altitude take-offs and landings. It can also operate in diverse missions, such as counter-terrorism, border patrol and intelligence gathering operations, which clearly fits the demands of countries like Mexico, said Liu.
According to Pan, military representatives from Peru and Brazil have contacted them to know more about their company's airborne early warning and control system, one of their major products.
The fair serves as a platform for Chinese companies to better connect with their partners in Latin America, said Hu Bin, regional deputy general manager from China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation.
More than 550 enterprises from 35 countries are participating in the four-day event, including world renowned companies of Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier.

SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China Vanke, the country's leading property developer, said Thursday night that its net profit for the first quarter of 2017 slumped 16.5 percent year on year to 695 million yuan (100.8 million U.S. dollars).
In its quarterly report, Vanke said the revenue in the three months rose 27.2 percent to 18.6 billion yuan.
During the quarter, its sales soared 99.7 percent year on year to 150.3 billion yuan.
Zhu Xu, secretary of the Vanke board, said the profit decline was mainly due to a seasonal factor and the profit for the whole of 2017 is still expected to grow.
Yan Yuejin, an analyst with E-house Real Estate Research Institute, said Vanke had projects across the country and some are in the smaller cities without housing cooling measures, thus giving more boost to its sales in the future.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese insurers should serve projects along the Belt and Road, the industry's top regulator said Thursday.
Chinese insurers should expand their presence in the Belt and Road regions and increase business in export credit insurance and overseas investment insurance, according to the guidelines released by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
The CIRC encouraged insurers to serve major national projects with controllable risks and help fund these projects with innovative approaches.
Insurers should speed up expansion overseas to offer underwriting, claim settlements and other services and collaborate with local counterparts to form industrial entities in reinsurance and investment.
The guidelines reminded insurers to beware of changes in global economic and political conditions and regional laws and regulations.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China Development Bank (CDB), a state-owned policy bank, said on Thursday that it will provide loans of 130 billion yuan (18.9 billion U.S. dollars) to support the development of Xiongan New Area.
The loan will be used in building traffic networks, infrastructure and ecological improvement in Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, said the bank.
By the end of March, the CDB had loaned more than 800 billion yuan to support the development of Hebei Province.
The plan for the Xiongan New Area was officially announced on April 1. The new area, some 100 kilometers south of Beijing, will eventually cover 2,000 square kilometers, with a population of 2 to 2.5 million. It is expected to help shift out Beijing's non-capital functions.
It is designed to be a green, livable and modern urban area, a region led by innovation-driven development, a demonstration area of balanced development, and a pioneering region of open development.

SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai authorities rolled out new measures Thursday to woo foreign investors, cutting restrictions on their access to the city's service and manufacturing sectors.
Accounting, auditing, architectural design and rating services, as well as financial services, will open wider to foreign investment, according to a directive issued by the Shanghai municipal government.
In addition, the government will press ahead with "orderly" opening of fields such as telecommunications, the Internet, culture, education and transportation, and welcomes foreign investment in government-backed science and technology projects, said the directive.
In the industrial sector, limits for foreign investors will be eased in the production of rail transit equipment, motorbikes and fuel.
The government supports foreign capital's involvement in advanced manufacturing industries, such as new information technology, new materials, intelligent equipment, biomedicine, aerospace, new energy and Internet-based automobiles.
It also hopes foreign investors could help sharpen the competitive edge of the city's traditional auto, steel, shipping and chemical industries.
What's more, new measures to open financial, telecommunications, the Internet, cultural, shipping, and maintenance services will be piloted in the Shanghai free trade zone.
By 2016, Shanghai had attracted more than 80,000 projects funded by foreign capital, with contractual foreign investments totaling around 400 billion U.S. dollars.
Last year, foreign-funded enterprises, the number of which accounted for 2 percent of the city's total, contributed 27 percent of the city's GDP and 20 percent of employment.
Foreign-funded enterprises have played an important role in Shanghai's efforts to make itself an international center for the economy, finance, trade and shipping, as well as for scientific and technological innovation, according to the local commerce commission.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The overall investment environment in China has been improving in recent years and China's door is going to keep opening wider, Sun Jiwen, spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce, said Thursday.
Sun's remarks came on the heels of the 2017 American Business in China White Paper released last week by the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China).
The White Paper argues that foreign-invested enterprises face many regulatory challenges in China, saying access to China's markets remains relatively restricted.
Attracting foreign investment is one important part of the basic state policy of reform and opening up, and China welcomes foreign companies to invest in China, Sun told reporters.
China welcomes foreign companies operating in China to share their insights to improve the country's investment environment through joint efforts, Sun said.
China is trying to create and protect a fair market environment for competition and is making service industries, manufacturing, and mining sectors more open to foreign investment, he said.
"Foreign companies will be treated the same as domestic companies when it comes to license applications, standards-setting and government procurement, and will enjoy the same preferential policies under the Made in China 2025 initiative according to this year's government work report released last month," Sun added.

Economic Watch: China manufacturing powers ahead on innovation

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Shaohua saw his engine manufacturing company recovering faster than he had expected, thanks to innovation and more outlays on new product design.
Weichai Power staged a comeback last year with its business revenue rising 25.6 percent year on year to 93.2 billion yuan (about 13.5 billion U.S. dollars) and net profit surging 72.9 percent to 2.4 billion yuan.
In 2015, life was much more difficult for the Shenzhen-listed company and its parent group, with more than 74,000 employees on its payroll.
Stringent environmental protection requirements on engine emissions and low demand, especially weaker sales of engines for heavy-duty trucks, weighed on Weichai Power, with revenue dipping 7.4 percent in 2015 and profits plunging 72.2 percent.
"The only way for Chinese manufacturers like us to thrive is through innovation and higher quality products," said Li, vice president of the company.
Despite cash flow constraints, the company spent 3.6 billion yuan on research and development in 2016, 9.5 percent more than in 2015, working on new energy vehicles (NEVs), lowering emissions, and producing greener and more reliable engines.
Weichai Power's transition is testimony to Chinese manufacturers' ascent of the value chain and economic restructuring.
In a similar vein, research and development expenditure across China rose 9.4 percent last year to 1.55 trillion yuan, just over 2 percent of the GDP, official data showed.
"China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth continues," the World Bank said in a report earlier this month, noting that economic growth will continue to moderate as capacity is cut and credit kept on a tight leash.
Industrial output growth in the hi-tech manufacturing sector reached 13.4 percent in Q1 this year, outstripping the 6.8-percent registered across all industrial companies.
Growth of traditional manufacturers is picking up, with emerging sectors like robots, NEVs and the sharing economy doing well, said Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Innovation is critical. "The ongoing supply-side structural reform will force Chinese businesses to sharpen competitiveness and improve overall growth quality, although the process will be painful," said Cai Zhizhou of Peking University.
Cutting overcapacity, deleveraging, lowering costs, reducing inventories and strengthening weak links of businesses to will generate sustainable long-term growth.
"The Chinese economy can upgrade gradually while tackling existing problems and alleviating risks," Ning said.
China's manufacturers face a downshift in growth, structural adjustment and a shift in growth engines, according to Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology, earlier this week.
China will upgrade its manufacturing industry with new policies to optimize the investment environment and support development of advanced manufacturing, Miao said.
Industrial upgrading and increasing productivity will take many years of reforms, instead of being achieved overnight, cautioned Zhao Yuncheng, a senior official at NBS.

China service trade deficit rises in March

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign service trade deficit continued to grow last month, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said Thursday.
The deficit stood at 152.3 billion yuan (22 billion U.S. dollars) in March, up from 17.6 billion U.S. dollars in February, SAFE data showed.
Income from trade in services was 117.8 billion yuan, while expenditure totaled 270.1 billion yuan.
Trade in services refers to the sale and delivery of intangible products such as transport, tourism, telecommunications, construction, advertising, computing and accounting.
China regularly holds a deficit in service trade as its service sector is less competitive than a number of other economies.
The government has channeled more energy into the sector and rolled out measures to improve service trade, including gradually opening up the finance, education, culture and medical sectors.
In contrast with the deficit in service trade, China's foreign goods trade ran a surplus of 210.6 billion yuan (30.6 billion U.S. dollars) in March, compared with a deficit of 4.8 billion U.S. dollars in goods trade in February.
In total, China's foreign service and goods trade held a surplus of 58.3 billion yuan in March, compared with a deficit of 154.2 billion yuan in February.

China Focus: Double-digit industrial profit growth points to stabilizing economy

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's major industrial firms continued to post double-digit growth in profits in March, adding to signs of a stabilizing Chinese economy, official data showed Thursday.
The companies reported a 23.8-percent year-on-year profit growth last month, slowing from 31.5 percent in January and February but still much faster than the 8.5-percent increase in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
In the first three months of the year, profits of major industrial firms rose 28.3 percent year on year, the NBS said in a statement.
The profit growth was supported by rising commodity prices, improved demand and expectations, as well as higher productivity, according to an analysis note from China Merchants Securities (CMS).
In the first quarter of 2017, major industrial firms saw profit margins of their primary business edge up 0.68 percentage points to 6.13 percent.
It was the first time the profit margin climbed above 6 percent since 2014, reflecting a better industrial structure and increased efficiency, the CMS said.
Meanwhile, the companies' debt-asset ratio dropped 0.7 percentage points to 56.2 percent.
NBS statistician He Ping noted the profit growth in March was of higher quality, as consumer product and equipment manufacturing accounted for a larger share of all newly-generated profits than in the January-February period, while the share of mining and raw material industries fell.
The manufacturing industry reaped 1.49 trillion yuan (216.2 billion U.S. dollars) of profits in the first three months, accounting for 87.5 percent of overall industrial profits, and up 23.4 percent year on year.
The industrial sector, which accounts for about a third of China's GDP, started to pick up last year after profit declines in 2015, helped by government efforts to cut overcapacity and a recovery in the property market.
Value-added industrial output expanded 6.8 percent year-on-year in the first three months, accelerating from 6.3 percent in January and February, and 6 percent in 2016.
"The sector was off to a good start in the first quarter, with some indicators, industries and regions performing better than expected," Zheng Lixin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said Wednesday.
The upbeat profit data came after a slew of other indicators suggesting improvement in the Chinese economy.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.8 in March, higher than the 51.6 recorded in February and staying above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row.
Unemployment fell 0.05 percentage points to 3.97 percent at the end of March from three months earlier, as more new jobs were created.
However, as commodity prices retreat, upstream industries may lose steam and drag down the overall industrial profit growth in future, the CMS said.
"Coal, oil and steel industries already posted slower profit increases in March," said He, who also warned of pressure from rising costs and financial expenses.
The annual industrial profit growth for this year will moderate to 15-20 percent, the CMS said.
China's GDP expanded 6.9 percent year on year in the first quarter, up from the 6.8-percent growth in the previous quarter and 6.7 percent in 2016.
It also beat previous market expectations of 6.8 percent and came well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.

This technology will also ensure a faster network and its seamless connectivity will help users engage with the digital world.
"Bangladeshi people are getting more data oriented in their daily lives, staying always connected is critical in today's world," Sanjay Vaghasia, chief digital officer of Banglalink, was quoted as saying in the statement.
"Our partnership with ZTE will enable us to embrace not only the digital agenda but with virtualization at an incredible pace, help us escalate faster, and increase our reach to our end customers whilst maintaining the highest standards of security," said the officer.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's actual gold consumption rose 14.73 percent to 304.14 tonnes in the first quarter of 2017 due to steady gold ornament sales and strong sales of gold bars, new data showed Thursday.
Thanks to strong demand around Chinese New Year, gold ornament sales rose 1.4 percent to 170.93 tonnes and gold bar sales surged 60.18 percent to 101.19 tonnes, the China Gold Association said.
The surge in gold bar sales came on the back of more people using them to hedge against risk as the public became more aware of its attributes, according to analysts.
Gold output in the first three months stood at 101.2 tonnes, down 9.29 percent from a year earlier, the association said.

TIANJIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of LinkedIn users in China has topped 32 million, more than three years after the world's largest professional network launched a Chinese version.

LinkedIn China chief Derek Shen said that "connecting global professionals" is what drove the company into the Chinese market.
Measures to boost its presence have included allowing users to bind their LinkedIn accounts with those on Chinese mobile app WeChat, as well as working with Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Financial.
A variety of other related activities and products, including a mobile version specially designed for Chinese users, have been developed.

BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Outbound Chinese tourists, the number of whom is growing rapidly in recent years, have gained much attention during the 2017 global summit of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) held in Bangkok from Wednesday to Thursday.
Many speakers talked about how to win a bigger share of Chinese tourists.
A total of 122 million Chinese tourists made outbound trips in 2016, while Thailand remained the top destination for Chinese tourists, according to a report jointly issued by Chinese travel services provider Ctrip and China Tourism Academy (CTA) in January.
"(The growing number of Chinese tourists) is the biggest opportunity for your tourism industry and for our countries," said former British Prime Minister David Cameron during his speech on Wednesday, noting that tens of millions of Chinese people join in the middle class and want to be travelers every year.
Indian market was also paid attention to during the summit as Indian service providers were also invited to share their ideas.
Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, asked the industry to get prepared and adapt itself for the future as China and India will become top tourism source markets in the near future.
Travel and tourism stimulates the economy by generating over 7.6 trillion U.S. dollars globally, supporting over 292 million jobs, which is now 1 in 10 jobs worldwide, said David Scowsill, president and CEO of WTTC, during his opening speech for the summit.
Scowsill urged over 900 leading figures from the public and private sectors to stand up and make a real difference.

SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Pudong Development (SPD) Bank Wednesday said its net profits for the first quarter of 2017 rose 3.88 percent year on year to 14.5 billion yuan (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
Revenue edged up 0.4 percent to 42.4 billion yuan in the three months, the bank said in its quarterly report released Wednesday night.
Weighed down by downward economic pressure, the profit and revenue growth slowed from 4.93 percent and 9.72 percent, respectively, for the whole of 2016.
The bank said its asset quality remained stable despite the complicated economic conditions.
Its total assets had amounted to 5.89 trillion yuan by the end of March, up 0.55 percent from the end of 2016. Meanwhile, its outstanding loans had risen to 2.93 trillion yuan, an increase of 172 billion yuan in the first quarter.
To spearhead its internationalization strategy, the bank opened its first overseas branch in Singapore in March.

Economic Watch: Policy makers signal unabated reforms despite economic upturn

Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-level meeting has sent fresh signals for more structural reforms in China despite better-than-expected improvement in the world's second-largest economy.
Authorities must base their judgement of the economic situation on "the logic of the new normal" and unswervingly press ahead with strategic restructuring, according to a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party China (CPC) Central Committee on Tuesday.
There were "cyclical factors" behind the economic upturn, and China still has a long way to go and faces many challenges in restructuring its economy, according to the meeting.
Efforts must be made to "ensure that supply-side structural reforms are deepened," it said.
These calls, against the backdrop of a robust first-quarter performance for the Chinese economy, showed that policy makers are sober-minded and will persevere with the much-needed structural reforms, economists said.
The meeting was a reminder that authorities should not be complacent about the good economic data and become slack in reforms, according to Xu Hongcai, an economist with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.
It remains to be seen whether the economic pickup will sustain, he cautioned, noting that the first-quarter improvement was related to the start of a recovery cycle for the global economy and relied heavily on infrastructure and property investment growth.
China's GDP expanded 6.9 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2017, up from the 6.8-percent growth in the previous quarter and 6.7 percent for 2016.
It also beat previous market expectations of 6.8 percent and came well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent.
While the achievement can be credited to previous reforms to reduce industrial overcapacity and boost consumption and innovation, a better external environment also played a supportive role.
The International Monetary Fund last week upgraded its forecast for the 2017 global economic growth to 3.5 percent from 3.4 percent in its January forecast. Both the euro-zone and Japan were given higher growth forecasts.
In March, China's exports in dollar-denominated terms rose 16.4 percent year on year, compared with a 1.3-percent decline in February and a 7.9-percent increase in January.
However, the external environment is far from stable. Further interest rate hikes in the United States will affect global capital flows, while rising protectionism could threaten trade growth, said Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics.
Domestically, though factory activity, company profit and employment data were stronger, some indicators pointed to persisting downside risks.
Industrial investment growth accelerated to 4.9 percent in the first quarter, but it was still well below the 9.2-percent growth rate for overall fixed-asset investment, official data showed.
During the same period, consumption contributed 77.2 percent of the GDP increase, but retail sales growth slowed to 10 percent from 10.4 percent last year.
"The momentum of recovery is still relatively weak, and much is to be done to maintain the positive trend," Ning said.
To support sustainable growth, deepened reforms are needed to accelerate the shift of China's economy from oldspider growth engines to new ones, said Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council.
He urged stronger measures to deleverage the economy, shed industrial overcapacity and property inventories, and reduce corporate costs.
The good start for the economy in the first quarter demonstrated the effect of supply-side structural reforms and, at the same time, created favorable conditions for advancing those reforms, according to Zhang.
Tuesday's CPC meeting called for more efforts to build a sound business environment, open up more sectors to investors, and improve market expectations.
Industrial restructuring will be firmly pushed forward to upgrade traditional sectors and foster new growth momentum to rejuvenate the real economy and facilitate economic transformation, according to the meeting.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks continued to rally Wednesday as improved economic fundamentals lifted investor confidence.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index went up 0.2 percent to close at 3,140.85 points while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.39 percent higher at 10,204.84 points.
Total turnover on the two bourses stood at 430.76 billion yuan (62.6 billion U.S. dollars), up from the previous day's 386.9 billion yuan.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board, ended 0.09 percent higher at 1,820.48 points.
Stocks related to the Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, jumped in the afternoon session. Shares of Tianjin Capital Environmental Protection Group, for example, rose by the daily limit of 10 percent.
Improved macroeconomic fundamentals, evidenced by a string of recent data, will continue to lift A-shares, especially bluechip stocks, analysts said.
In the first quarter, China reported better-than-expected 6.9-percent economic growth, beating the full-year target of 6.5 percent.
The job market also showed signs of improvement. China added 3.34 million new jobs in the first quarter, 160,000 higher than in the same period last year, while unemployment fell by 0.07 percentage points to 3.97 percent.
The economic recovery could benefit shares of industry leaders, whose share prices are currently undervalued, according to Guosen Securities.
Bluechip shares in industries such as home appliance, food and beverage, and automobiles have some upside potential, according to China International Capital Corporation, an investment firm.

China crude steel output up 4.6 pct in Q1

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- China's crude steel output grew 4.6 percent year-on-year to 201.1 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2017, an industry association said Wednesday.
In the first three months, China's steel exports declined 25 percent year on year to 20.73 million tonnes, the China Iron and Steel Association said in a press release.
Steel exports to the United States plunged 51.76 percent year-on-year in 2016 to 1.17 million tonnes, accounting for 1.08 percent of China's total steel exports.
Wang Yingsheng, deputy secretary general of the association, said the U.S. stance on investigating steel imports would not exert much influence on China's steel industry.
In the first quarter, sales revenues of China's steel companies rose by more than 40 percent year-on-year to hit a total of 839.3 billion yuan (about 122 billion U.S. dollars).
China's over-supplied steel sector has experienced years of plunging prices and factory shutdowns due to a sluggish economy. However, with an upward trend in prices since the start of 2016, many steel mills are resuming production.
The central government has reiterated that cutting overcapacity is high on its reform agenda in 2017 as excess capacity in sectors such as steel and coal has weighed on the country's economic performance.
Its 2016 target to cut 45 million tonnes was achieved ahead of schedule.
China plans to reduce steel output by an additional 100 million to 150 million tonnes by 2020.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Cash withdrawals using bank cards fell in volume for the first time in China, as the country enters a cashless society with mobile payments growing in popularity.
About 65.5 trillion yuan (9.51 trillion U.S. dollars) was withdrawn using bank cards last year, down 10.46 percent year on year, a report from the Payment & Clearing Association of China (PCAC) showed Wednesday.
The growth rate of payment via bank cards has fallen for three consecutive years, due to sluggish growth of large-volume transactions and increasing use of mobile payments, such as paying by screening a barcode, according to Wang Suzhen, deputy secretary with the PCAC.
Meanwhile, online payment grew fast, with non-banking payment platforms seeing their business volume more than double in 2016.
Chinese also tend to use mobile terminals more than computers to pay online, the report showed.
Chinese mobile payment giants have been encouraging a cashless society. Earlier this month, Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Financial said it planned to spend 6 billion yuan in the next two years to push forward the drive.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Net profits of the Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco), China's top aluminum producer, increased sharply in Q1.
The company made 920 million yuan (about 130 million U.S. dollars) net profit in the first three months, nearly four times the amount in the same period last year. Revenue approximately doubled, according to the company's first quarter report released Tuesday.
"The profits are associated with the long-term promising outlook in the economy," an official of Chalco said, adding that improved management also boosted profits.
Chalco made a total profit of about 1.66 billion yuan last year, 11 times the 2015 level. The company posted a strong start this year with Q1 profits making up more than half of the full-year figure of 2016.
Analysts attributed Chalco's good performance to cost control and proper handling of "zombie enterprises".

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tech giant Xiaomi made its official debut in Russia Tuesday with three new products in its latest move to expand overseas.
At its first official presentation in the country, Xiaomi brought three new smartphones the Mi MIX, Mi Note 2 and Redmi 4X, reaffirming the importance of the Russian market after the company first started selling products there six months ago through a partnership with distributor RDC.
As a long-term strategic partner, RDC distributes, markets and supports Xiaomi products in Russia, and has also developed a network of official service centers.
To date, RDC has opened six Mi Authorized Reseller Stores and point of sale locations, including two in Moscow, one in St. Petersburg and one in Vladivostok, offering consumers the full Xiaomi experience.

Chinese economy firming, recovery sustainable: official

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official on Wednesday reiterated confidence in the Chinese economy, saying the improving trend is strengthening and recovery should be sustainable.
In an interview with Xinhua, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission Ning Jizhe highlighted an optimizing structure and shifting growth drivers when explaining 6.9 percent GDP growth in Q1.
The growth was slightly up from 6.8 percent in the previous quarter, with 77.2 percent of it was driven by consumption, 12.6 percentage points higher than the overall 2016 level.
"Consumption has become the primary driving force for growth," said Ning, who is also head of the National Bureau of Statistics.
The service sector accounted for 56.5 percent of GDP, a sign of an optimizing industrial structures, he said.
New growth impetus is coming from sectors such as high-tech, equipment manufacturing and strategic emerging industry, all of which generated double-digit growth and outperformed the economy as a whole, according to Ning.
New opportunities in traditional industries and emerging business models, such as the sharing economy, are also driving growth.
The five major macro indicators -- employment, growth rate, inflation, international balance sheets and incomes -- all point to a stabilizing economy, Ning said, while warning against being overly optimistic as many challenges and difficult reforms still lie ahead.
GDP growth rate is not the sole standard of economic performance, Ning stressed.
"As long as the job market and inflation remain steady and incomes keep improving, it does not matter the growth is a touch higher or lower," he said.
China has set the 2017 growth target at around 6.5 percent, but hopes for better if possible.
On the risk front, Ning underscored the persistent problems of industrial overcapacity, risks in the property and financial sectors and uneven regional growth.
Industrial investment growth, although slightly up at 4.9 percent in the first quarter, is still low and shows the market has yet to fully recover, he added.
To put the economy on a steadier footing, China should stand firm on restructuring and reforms and gradually dissolve risks in the process, Ning said.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector, which accounts for more than one-third of China's GDP, picked up steam in the first quarter of the year, but still faces challenges at home and abroad, a senior official said Wednesday.
The sector was off to a good start in the first quarter, with some indicators, industries and regions performing better than expectation, Zheng Lixin, spokesman of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), said at a press conference.
China's industrial production expanded at a faster pace, with the value-added industrial output rising 6.8 percent year on year in the first three months, up from 6.3 percent for January and February, and 6 percent for 2016.
The sector's profitability and entrepreneur confidence also improved, Zheng said. An MIIT survey of 6,000 enterprises showed 44.2 percent of them registered sound performance in the first quarter, up from 32.2 percent a year before.
Zheng said the country was pushing supply-side structural reform in the sector, cutting excessive capacity and strengthening competitiveness.
He said more supportive policies were needed to sustain momentum in the sector, which was still plagued by a protracted global economic recovery, weak investment growth and rising operating costs.

LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- More than one third of all offshore Chinese renminbi foreign exchange transactions are carried out in the United Kingdom, according to the SWIFT renminbi tracker.
SWIFT, the financial transactions firm, released the data identifying London as the world's leading hub for offshore renminbi in a report on Tuesday. London is the world's largest single FX-trading center.
"This data demonstrates that London is a top choice for international banking activity, says Javier Perez-Tasso, chief executive of Americas and UK for SWIFT.
"Despite a decline in global FX trading volumes and broader market uncertainties, London's role as a global financial center and international payments hub remains on a strong footing," he said.
The SWIFT report said there has also been a steady increase in renminbi FX transactions over the last five years, with the number of FX trades in renminbi reaching more than 13 million in 2016.
In addition, the renminbi now ranks fifth as a world FX currency in terms of trading value, behind the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound and monthly turnover of the renminbi has reached over 4.3 percent of total turnover confirmed over SWIFT systems.
Trading and payments in the renminbi in Britain also continues to grow, supported by usage of the renminbi in both global and domestic markets.

Companies ordered to pay for Doraemon copyright infringement

NANJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Two companies in eastern China have been ordered to pay 130,000 yuan (18,878 U.S. dollars) in compensation for copyright infringement of the popular Japanese cartoon character Doraemon.
A Shanghai-based company, which owns the copyright on the Chinese mainland, sued the companies in Zhenjiang city, Jiangsu Province, for using the Doraemon images without authorization. It asked for compensation of 550,000 yuan, according to a statement from Zhenjiang City Intermediate People's Court.
The two companies displayed Doraemon models in a co-managed public square near a central business district in January 2016, which "could generate huge commercial benefits," according to the acting lawyer of the Shanghai company.
The defendants argued that they rented the models to "just enliven holiday spirit," and no commercial behavior was involved. They erased the display before the court session started in order to stop the copyright infringement.
However, the court decided that the defendants infringed the plaintiff's rights of display and information dissemination.
"Images such as Doraemon and minions are everywhere, but that does not mean that such images can be used at random," a court judge said.
Doraemon is a blue cartoon cat that produces toys from a magic pocket on his stomach. He is one of the most popular cartoon characters in China.

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tech giant Baidu and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have further collaborated on technological innovations to tackle social issues.
Baidu President Zhang Yaqin and UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in China Nicholas Rosellini on Tuesday called on the public to join their Global Responsibility Innovation Programme to open resources like technology to bring innovative solutions for sustainable development.
The two parties launched the Global Responsibility Innovation Programme last December to encourage innovative proposals from the public to answer increasing development challenges. The first open design challenge was held Tuesday.
The contest received over 2,000 proposals from China and abroad, mostly on environmental protection and poverty alleviation.
The top prize went to student teams from Tsinghua University and Beihang University, who proposed using deep learning technologies to turn sign language into voice to help the hearing-impaired communicate.
Baidu will grant outstanding applicants and teams access to its technology, to help address public concerns via technologies, and contribute to U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.
Cooperation between Baidu and the UNDP goes back a long way. In 2014, the Baidu-UNDP Big Data Joint Lab was started, aiming to find big data solutions on environmental protection and other human development challenges. Together they developed Baidu Recycle to promote responsible consumption and production.

NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese direct investment in the United States tripled in 2016 with Chinese companies employing more than 140,000 Americans, according to a report released on Tuesday.
Already on a steep growth trajectory for the past five years, Chinese investment in the United States jumped to 46 billion U.S. dollars last year, a 200-percent increase from the previous record of 15 billion dollars set in 2015, according to the report published by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic research firm.
"As an observer and participant in the early wave of U.S. investments in China, I saw firsthand the power of well deployed capital to revitalize communities and change lives," Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, wrote in the report.
"Today I am watching a similar story begins to unfold with Chinese investment in the U.S.," Orlins added.
By the end of last year, about 3,200 Chinese-owned companies operated in the United States across 98 percent congressional districts and employed more than 140,000 Americans, more than nine times higher than 2009, the report said.
The report pointed out that the increasing number of American workers hired by Chinese companies echoes U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign promise to create more jobs in the country.
"The data overwhelmingly suggests that Chinese investment in the United States is complementary to the current administration's focus on creating and protecting American jobs," said Orlins.

HANOVER, Germany, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The vice president of Midea Group, a Chinese electrical appliances manufacturer, said Tuesday that the company's cooperation with German robotics and system technology company KUKA, was beneficial to both.
The vice-president, Andy Gu, now also the chairman of KUKA's supervisory board, made the remarks at Hanover Messe, the biggest industrial fair held yearly in the city.
Midea completed its takeover of KUKA in the first half of January, and now controls 94.55 percent of shares.
KUKA's Smart Factory, which is capable of manufacturing, packaging, and supplying a highly customized product for trade visitors, made an appearance at the fair and attracted a great deal of attention.
Visitors need only to put in a personal image using a smartphone and tablet and the Smart Factory handles all subsequent procedures.
"It's the first time KUKA has shown the public the complete Industry 4.0 solution, combining digitalization, automation and customization," Gu said.
According to Gu, KUKA, as a mature factory automation solution provider, can help Midea upgrade in this regard. In return, Midea, as one of the leading players in the Chinese market, can bring KUKA many business opportunities in China's various industries.



Economic Watch: Chinese ports cruise on sustainable routes

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- On top of fast business growth at the start of this year, Chinese ports aim to become greener and more sustainable with strengthened core competitiveness.
In the first quarter this year, the container throughput at major Chinese ports rose 7.2 percent to 53.7 million standard units, buttressed by surging business at some key ports, according to figures from the Ministry of Transport.
The container throughput at Shanghai port and Ningbo Zhoushan Port in eastern China's Zhejiang Province jumped 9.5 percent and 9.2 percent year on year, respectively.
The business growth rate outpaced the 1.9 percent registered a year ago and the GDP growth of 6.9 percent in the first quarter this year, beating market expectations. Container throughput is considered a barometer of economic growth, together with freight volume and power use.
"The momentum of Chinese port business picked up in tandem with a rebounding of domestic consumption, industrial production and logistics," said Jiang Mingbao, a senior official with the ministry, adding that Chinese ports are likely to witness steady growth in the next five to ten years on the back of a firming economy.
However, like many Chinese industries plagued by overcapacity, Chinese ports nationwide are engaged in homogeneous competition with the profit margins of their traditional business waning, industry observers said.
"Some ports are afflicted by an excessive handling capacity for bulk cargo and petroleum products," cautioned Wu Chungeng, spokesperson of the ministry.
The view was echoed by entrepreneurs including Li Jin, deputy general manager of Nanjing Port Group based in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, who said that Chinese ports are confronted with multi-pronged challenges including excessive handling capacity, rising operational costs and more stringent supervision.
The port industry is witness to the painful but necessary transition in the Chinese economy, which aims to rely more on innovation and high value-added products and services by reducing energy intensity.
Despite the anemic global economic and trade recovery, the listed arm of Nanjing Port Group raked in 85 million yuan (about 12.3 million U.S. dollars) in net profit last year, representing a surge of 290 percent from 2015, as the company provided tailor-made services in logistics and expanded business into areas including port machinery manufacturing and harbor engineering.
Business innovation and greener strategies are critical to many Chinese companies' climb up the value chain and their sustainable development. Improved salaries and living conditions for workers have allowed other countries to gain market share of low-end products once produced in China, where ecological degradation has aroused public concern.
About 60 percent of vessels moored at docks in southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality have access to cleaner electricity generated by power plants in the city instead of that powered by diesel generators installed on vessels, official figures showed.
Ports nationwide are also beefing up supervision of waste treatment and dangerous chemicals leakage, while some ports in Zhejiang Province have invited private capital to participate in treatment of sewage and oil spills from vessels through the government's purchase of public services.
China is trying to promote green and smart development of transport services, according to a white paper titled "Development of China's Transport" released at the end of last year.
China is striving to push forward green development of transportation through conservation and intensive use of resources while promoting the use of standardized, low-carbon, and modern equipment and energy-saving means in the transport sector, noted the white paper.

China improves IPR protection

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has taken steps to better protect intellectual property rights (IPR) as part of larger effort to create a more innovative economy.
Chinese police solved 17,000 cases involving IPR infringement worth 4.6 billion yuan (670 million U.S. dollars) in 2016, Shen Changyu, head of the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said at a press conference Tuesday.
Customs authorities seized more than 17,000 shipments of goods suspected of IPR infringement in 2016, involving about 42 million individual units, Shen noted.
Chinese courts heard 136,500 IPR cases in 2016, a 24.8 percent increase. A total of 3,797 people were arrested and 7,059 were prosecuted.
Industry and commerce regulators increased online supervision and inspection in rural markets that are prone to counterfeits.
They solved nearly 50,000 IPR cases worth about 560 million yuan, and transferred 293 cases worth 160 million yuan to courts in 2016, said Liu Junchen, deputy director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
The copyright watchdog has instigated 5,578 cases involving Internet IPR infringement and shut down 3,079 websites, with total fines of 20.5 million yuan, since 2005, said Yu Cike, director of the copyright management department under the National Copyright Administration.
In March, China's cabinet, the State Council, issued a guideline on counterfeiting and IPR infringements demanding better market supervision system and improvements to the law, regulations and standards with appropriate information technology utilized in supervision.
A group of IPR protection centers will be established to fast-track cases involving IPR infringement, said Shen.
With the government's efforts to improve IPR protection, the country's inventiveness has grown.
China's patent office received nearly 1.34 million applications for invention patents in 2016, up 21.5 percent year on year. Chinese inventors made more than 40,000 international applications last year.
China continued to top global trademark applications in 2016, with about 3.7 million trademark applications, up 28.4 percent on 2015. The number of valid trademarks registered in China was nearly 12.4 million by the end of 2016.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's pension funds continued to grow in the first quarter this year, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said on Tuesday.
The gross revenue of pension funds totaled 970.8 billion yuan (141 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter with gross expenditures at 808.5 billion yuan, said the ministry.
The figures represented a year-on-year increase of 25.4 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively. The pension funds' account balance stood at over 4 trillion yuan at the end of March.
The ministry said that pension funds have been managed more effectively during the first quarter, with supervision in place to contain risks and ensure stable development.
China is home to more than 220 million people over the age of 60, or 16.1 percent of the population, and the numbers are growing.
As the population ages, China is trying to increase the value of its locally managed pension funds to cope with the needs of its aging population.
Pensions are traditionally held by banks or used to purchase treasury bills. They are now allowed to be invested in a variety of financial products, including bonds and stocks.
Since the end of 2016, seven provincial-level regions have entrusted their pensions to the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF) in the hope of more diverse and higher returns.
A total of 360 billion yuan is being transferred from bank accounts across the country, operated by local authorities, to the NCSSF for investment.
The government has set a 30-percent limit on the proportion of pension funds tied up in stocks.

Central China becoming ideal destination for foreign investment: MOC

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Central China is becoming an ideal destination for foreign investment, according to a senior commerce official Tuesday.
Unlike coastal areas, central China has many unique advantages in attracting foreign investment, which saw similar FDI growth to the national average in the first quarter of this year, Wang Shouwen, deputy head of the Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference about the Expo Central China 2017, to be held in Hefei, capital of central China's Anhui Province from May 17 to May 19.
Central China includes six provinces: Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Shanxi.
Chinese exporters can send their products via China Railway Express to Central Asia and Europe while products made in central China can exploit markets in both east and west of the country, according to Wang.
Central Chinese provinces are rich in labor and talent as many local people have returned from coastal areas to seek jobs or set up their own businesses, he added.
To encourage foreign investment in central China, the central authorities decided in March to allow 43 sectors in the region to enjoy preferential policies such as reduced taxation when receiving foreign investment.
For the first time since the Expo Central China began in 2006, China will hold a high-level meeting during the expo to gather ideas and suggestions by foreign companies to help improve the investment environment, according to Wang.

Economic Watch: China moves to deleverage without destabilizing growth
Source: Xinhua
2017-04-25 21:03:59
Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China is walking a tightrope between deleveraging and maintaining growth.
Authorities have tightened financial regulation and credit control and are using an expanded monetary policy toolkit to deleverage without stymieing an economic recovery.
Policy makers are wary of debt piling up in corporations, local governments and even households. They are eyeing investment booms in financial markets ranging from stocks, bonds to farm produce futures with extreme caution. This year, the task in hand is to reduce leverage and contain financial risks.
Things have escalated in recent weeks. The banking regulator has issued a flurry of directives on risk control and threatened to come down hard on malpractice. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) last week ordered lenders to conduct self-inspections, focus on non-performing loans, fix regulation loopholes, and engage in more debt-for-equity swaps.
The Financial News, affiliated with the central bank, ran an editorial Monday saying the supervision under central bank's risk monitoring system -- the macro prudential assessment -- and CBRC scrutiny were both aimed at deleveraging and controlling financial risks. More such policies are in the pipeline.
Concern over the regulatory squeeze has weighed on the stock market, which on Monday posted its worst performance this year. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 1.37 percent.
The interbank market is also feeling the strain, with the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate -- the cost at which Chinese banks lend to one another -- up 3.57 basis points on Tuesday to 2.75 percent, the highest level in more than two years.
Tightening is likely to hurt excessively levered carry trades, but unlikely to spill over to the real economy, said Liu Wenqi, an analyst at China International Capital Corporation.
Policy makers need to better manage the frequency and intensity of monetary and regulatory tweaks, balancing the contradictory goals of reduced leverage and sustained recovery, said Zeng Gang, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
With monetary policy shifting away from a relatively loose stance, the central bank has been feathering, not slamming on, the credit brakes.
Commercial banks made a total of 4.2 trillion yuan (610 billion U.S. dollars) in new yuan loans in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from a year before, the first year-on-year decrease since 2011.
M2, a broad measure of money supply that covers cash in circulation and all deposits, grew 10.6 percent to about 160 trillion yuan at the end of March. The pace of increase slowed 2.8 percentage points compared with the same month last year.
Zeng believes China has finally shifted away from credit-fueled stimuli to better control of the "credit floodgate" and use funds more efficiently.
Over the past year, the central bank has steered clear of interest rate cuts and avoided tinkering with reserve requirement ratios. Instead, it employed a range of tools, such as reverse repos and lending facilities to manage liquidity.
Following the tightening of regulations, the central bank continued cash injections into the banking system to help avert any severe cash shortages. Some 170 billion yuan was pumped into the market last week, the largest weekly cash injection in three months.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank continued cash injections into the money market through open market operations on Tuesday to ease liquidity.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 80 billion yuan (11.6 billion U.S. dollars) of reverse repos, resulting in a net 40 billion yuan added to the market, as 40 billion yuan of previous reverse repos became due on Tuesday.
The operations included 40 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repo prices to yield 2.45 percent, 20 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent, and 20 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
It was the PBOC's sixth straight cash injection via reverse repos as lending costs remained on the up.
On Tuesday's interbank market, the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor) climbed to 2.7514 percent, the highest in more than two years.

Economic Watch: Falling jobless rate delivers positive message on Chinese economy

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's quarterly jobs report delivered a positive message about the world's second-largest economy Tuesday.
Official data showed that 3.34 million new jobs were created in the first quarter and the unemployment rate fell to 3.97 percent.
The number of new jobs was 160,000 higher than that in the same period last year, and the unemployment rate was down 0.07 percentage points from a year earlier and 0.05 percentage points lower compared with the previous quarter.
"China's job market posted a strong start this year and remained stable in the first quarter," said Lu Aihong, spokesperson of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, at a press conference.
Economists said the lower jobless rate suggested a healthier picture for the Chinese economy.
From January to March, job vacancies rose 7.8 percent year on year while applicants increased 2.1 percent, according to data from the ministry.
"The need for workers is particularly pressing in the manufacturing sector," said Zhang Yizhen, vice minister of human resources and social security.
China's manufacturing sector in March stayed above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row, reinforcing the message conveyed by increased industrial business profits, and shedding light on economic restructuring progress.
Meanwhile, employment picked up as more people came back for work after the Chinese New Year. According to a poll conducted by the ministry of 3,314 companies, the number of workers in these firms increased 4.6 percent to over 2 million, compared with the 1.93 million before the holiday.
"The string of employment data is in line with macroeconomic data released earlier," said Zhou Tianyong, professor at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
China's better-than-expected 6.9-percent economic growth in the first quarter has once again proved that the world's second-largest economy remains an important engine driving global growth.
The reading, the fastest increase in 18 months, was above the full-year target of 6.5 percent and the 6.8-percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2016.
"If you look at the structure of the economy, the service industry is creating more jobs," said the ministry's spokesperson.
China's service sector expanded 7.7 percent year on year in the first quarter, up 0.1 percentage point compared to a year ago. It accounted for 56.5 percent of the country's GDP.
While the employment data pointed to an optimistic economic outlook, challenges remain, experts said.
There are both quantitative and structural problems. On the one hand, more than 15 million people, including nearly 8 million college graduates, will enter the job market this year. On the other hand, technical and skilled workers are badly needed.
The government has rolled out an array of pro-employment policies for college graduates, laid-off workers from glutted industries, and migrant workers, while the country's entrepreneurial wave has also helped job creation.
According to Chen Yu, vice director of the China Association of Employment Promotion, the key lies in the implementation of those policies.
For example, banks sometimes still require a guarantor who works in a government agency for entrepreneurs applying for loans, making the process more complex than needed.
Authorities should step up policy support, including further tax cuts while allocating more subsidies to small and medium enterprises, which provide more than 75 percent of urban jobs, according to Zhou.
Additionally, China's social security system has improved and benefited more people, according to the spokesperson.
The population covered under social insurance schemes such as pensions and health insurance continued to expand while insurance fund revenue maintained stable growth, said Lu.
Tuesday's data also showed that gross revenue of social insurance funds increased 26.9 percent year on year to 1.53 trillion yuan (about 222.4 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of March, while gross expenditures totaled 1.18 trillion yuan, up 21.7 percent from a year ago.
China's social insurance funds include basic pension funds, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance.
Pension funds have also been managed more effectively during the first quarter, with supervision in place to contain risks, Lu added.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks retrieved some lost ground on Tuesday after the previous day's decline, while market concerns about stricter financial supervision remained.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.16 percent higher at 3134.57 points, following a 1.37-percent drop on Monday.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index ended 0.73 percent higher at 10,165.22 points.
Total turnover on the two bourses stood at 386.9 billion yuan (56.2 billion U.S. dollars), down from the previous day's 411.9 billion yuan.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, rose 0.5 percent to close at 1,818.87 points.
Stocks related to Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, rallied after days of weakness. Shares of five companies, including a property developer and an environmental firm, rose by the daily limit of 10 percent.
Liquor makers also performed strongly, with Kweichow Moutai rising 5.1 percent to 418.89 yuan.
However, analysts said the low turnover showed investors were still cautious due to anxiety over strengthened financial regulation.
China's financial regulators have stepped up oversight and issued harsher punishments to remedy shortcomings and promote efficiency in a campaign to protect against systemic financial crisis.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's online retail sales posted robust growth in the first quarter, reflecting a changing consumption pattern, official data showed.
Online retail volume reached over 1.4 trillion yuan (200 billion U.S. dollars) in the first three months of 2017, up 32.1 percent year on year and more than double the pace of total retail sales, data from the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) showed.
Online consumption of services such as tourism, dining and entertainment continued to rise, with sales of travel and take-away food rising by 64 percent and 163 percent respectively.
Chinese consumers spent more on high-end products such as upscale clothing, smart glasses and sensor-controlled vehicles.
Central and western regions posted stronger growth in online spending and online shoppers in third-and-fourth-tier cities. Rural areas also outperformed their counterparts in first-and-second-tier cities.
Alibaba and JD.com are expanding offline to improve the consumer experience with convenience stores as an emerging market, the MOC observed.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's installed wind power capacity continued to grow in the first quarter this year, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA).
China had 151 million kilowatts of installed wind power capacity as of the end of the first quarter, up 13 percent year on year.
Provinces of Qinghai, Shaanxi, Henan and Hebei increased the most in wind power capacity during the first three months, the NEA said in an official statement.
Wind power facilities generated 68.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in the first quarter, 26 percent more than in the same period in 2016.
Due to distribution of wind resources and an imperfect grid system, 13.5 billion kilowatt hours of wind power was wasted in the first quarter, down 5.7 billion kilowatt hours from the same period last year.
China's energy mix is dominated by coal. Power consumption rose 6.9 percent year on year in the first three quarters of the year, 3.7 percentage points higher than the same period last year, official data showed.
Thanks to China's push for renewable energy, the country's energy intensity, the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP, decreased 3.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier this month.
China's total energy consumption will be capped at 5 billion tonnes of coal equivalent by 2020, according to a government plan for 2016 to 2020. This will amount to a 15 percent reduction of energy use per unit of GDP by 2020.

China Focus: Outlook stable for Chinese property developers after bumper year
Source: Xinhua
2017-04-25 15:37:16
Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese property developers enjoyed a bumper year in 2016 due to strong sales and easing monetary policies, and a strong start this year continued to bode well for the industry despite rising uncertainties.
The 96 property firms that have released annual reports showed that their combined business revenue was 908.1 billion yuan in 2016 (about 132 billion U.S. dollars), up 28.5 percent year on year, according to a report by Xinhua-run Economic Information Daily, which cited data from leading real estate agency Centaline Property.
Their combined profits were 88.33 billion yuan, a jump of 28.9 percent from the previous year that brought the sector's net profit margin to 9.73 percent from 9.69 percent in 2015.
The profit rebound is largely attributable to easing policy environment for most of 2016, which saw a boost in both prices and sales.
China's property sales recorded strong growth in 2016 with an annual gain of 22.5 percent, thanks to two years of policy easing, starting with relaxation of purchasing restrictions in 2014.
The report also noted the trend of divergence among property developers, with the stronger ones showing faster profit growth and more resilience than less competent players.
Research from the China Index Academy found a progressive decrease in the profitability levels at the top 100 property companies in China. That is to say, as you moved lower down the ladder, companies made less profits.
"The larger and stronger companies reported faster profit growth due to their advantages in capital access and funding costs...the market share of leading firms is on a notable rise," said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with Centaline Property.
For the industry's outlook in 2017, a majority of property firms stood optimistic on the market although tightening policy restrictions in major cities are set to slow sales.
Since October last year, the Chinese government has implemented a slew of measures to cool runaway housing prices, including restrictions on home purchases and increased minimum down-payment requirements.
Dozens of Chinese cities have implemented tougher cooling measures to limit price gains since mid-March, following Beijing's unprecedentedly strict curbs that lifted the downpayment ratio for second homes to 60 percent.
Even against this backdrop, major property developers have set higher performance targets for 2017. Developer Sunac China set its sales target for 2017 at 210 billion yuan, a jump of 35.21 percent from 2016.
"Major indices for property development are still on the rise, which showed government restrictive policies have not fully affected companies' confidence and the fundamentals for the property market remained stable," said Yan Yuejin, senior researcher with E-house China R&D Institute.
In a report released Monday, Moody's said China's property sales would slow from the high level in 2016 but remain within the parameters for a stable outlook.
However, the report noted that the government's wider implementation of home-purchase restrictions since September 2016 will slow sales and tighten developers' liquidity gradually, leading to more competition.
The competition resulting from slowing sales, and tightening liquidity and regulation will be exacerbated by developers' continued focus on high sales growth in 2017, according to Moody's.

NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's non-performing loans have stabilized and pressure from capital flight has eased off, Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said here on Monday.
Yi made the remarks at the International Finance and Infrastructure Forum in New York. While acknowledging that China's financial market still faces different types of risks, he said that "the overall risk is under control."
"Non-performing loans are getting pretty much stabilized after a long time of climbing," said Yi.
China's non-performing ratio declined in the fourth quarter of 2016, the first time since 2012, suggesting that the loan losses that have posed risks to the country's financial market are finally easing. At the end of 2016, lenders saw the ratio of their non-performing loans fall to 1.74 percent, slightly down from 1.76 percent a quarter ago.
"The capital outflow pressure has been alleviated recently but still we have to keep an eye on the phenomenon and see what the underlying reason is," Yi said.
He pledged to improve shadow banking regulation and transparency and monitor non-performing loans, capital outflow and divergent movement of property prices in cities in order to prevent systematic risks.
China has made great efforts to open up its financial market and will further open up its bond market to foreign investors along with the internationalization of the RMB, the deputy governor said.
He added that steady progress has been made as the country opened up its onshore bond market to overseas investors, introduced more investment products and opened up market to more foreign bond issuers.
"By the end of last year, there are over 400 foreign institutions investing in China's interbank bond market with a total amount of more than 800 billion yuan (116.17 U.S. dollars)," Yi said.
The central bank will continue to work to solve problems like low-efficiency and lack of transparency to make the market more accessible to foreign investors, he added.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Growth scares come and go in the Chinese economy, but they never eclipse its resilience.
Once again, the doomsayers were caught out when China's statistics agency reported higher-than-expected growth of 6.9 percent in the first quarter, an eye-popping figure in a still precarious global environment.
The Chinese economy was once renowned for the hum of its assembly lines, the belch of its smokestacks and the clang of its construction sites.
But gradually, consumption and service sector have become new benchmarks of the Chinese economy. In the first quarter, 77.2 percent of growth was driven by consumption, and the service sector accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy. In terms of growth, the service sector leaves agriculture and the secondary industry far behind.
Robust growth produces well-paid jobs. China's unemployment rate has stayed under 5 percent while resident's per capita real disposable income outpaced the GDP growth.
Premier Li Keqiang has said that China's economy has not only been able to avoid a "hard landing," but is also stabilizing and improving with a better structure and more jobs.
A resilient China was depicted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a key factor offering a sunnier outlook for the global economy, helping dispel the gloom that has lingered since the Great Recession ended.
After raising China's 2017 growth projection to 6.6 percent, the IMF said it might raise the forecast again.
While the world economy is stuck in the doldrums, China is running like a powerhouse. World Bank data showed it contributed more than 30 percent of global growth in 2016.
While there are encouraging signs, China is not immune from risks. It has a long to-do list, with reform at the top.
The IMF has warned of breakneck expansion in bank lending and dangerous real estate bubbles. Effective measures are essential to resolve these problems to prevent them from growing too costly to solve.
The Chinese government has put supply-side structural reform as its top priority for economic management. The reform will help address excess capacity, restrain credit and curb debts. No one should doubt the government's resolution.
With the world economy facing tighter financial conditions and rising protectionism, the Chinese economy is heading for a bumpy journey. However, confidence should be maintained given China's resolution and resilience.

ZHENGZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Luoyang, China's "city of peonies," will export 1 million cut flowers to Australia, as part of a flower trade cooperation.
Shenzhou peony company, a major flower growing enterprise in Luoyang of central China's Henan Province, has signed a deal with several Australian distributors to sell 1 million peonies and Chinese herbaceous peonies to Australian customers in 2017.
"In order to pass the quarantine inspection of Australia, we have translated Australian standards and import regulations on cut flowers, and offered training to flower farmers since last year," said Guo Xueliang, head of the city's entry-exit inspection and quarantine bureau.
"It is estimated that each cut flower will cost three Australian dollars, more than five times the price in China," said a deputy general manager with the company surnamed Cao.
Cao added that the company would expand its flower planting scale next year to meet the growing demand of cut flowers in foreign markets.
Statistics show that Luoyang exports fewer than 100,000 peonies and Chinese herbaceous peonies to foreign countries and regions each year. It is expected to export 20 million such flowers in the following two to three years.
The city has been growing peonies for more than 1,500 years. The flower was preferred by royal families for its luxuriant blossom, which symbolizes prosperity and wealth.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China is aiming to become a world auto-making powerhouse in a decade, vowing to boost development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and relax restrictions on foreign ownership.
The country will strive to achieve breakthroughs in key technologies and markedly increase the share of Chinese brands in the international auto market by 2025, according to an auto industry development plan released Tuesday by three government departments, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
By 2020, China will see NEV output and sales hit 2 million annually, the plan said.
That number is about four times the current level. China sold 507,000 NEVs last year, the most in the world for a second year and up 53 percent from 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
Restrictions on foreign ownership in the country's joint-venture car makers will be relaxed "in an orderly manner," the plan noted.
China, the world's largest auto market, caps foreign stakes in joint ventures in the domestic auto industry at 50 percent.
The government plan also predicted China's annual auto output to reach around 30 million by 2020 and 35 million by 2025.
Auto sales in the country hit a record high of 28.03 million in 2016, up 13.7 percent year on year, according to CAAM.

Distilled in the town of Maotai in southwest China's Guizhou Province, Moutai is considered the country's national liquor and often served on official occasions and at state banquets.

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The average price of food in 50 Chinese cities continued to drop between April 11 and April 20, official data showed Monday.
Prices of pork, chicken and egg declined from the last sampled period of April 1 to April 10, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Beans led the fall in vegetable prices by losing 6.8 percent, while cucumber and tomato prices dipped by 3.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.
The 10-day snapshot could reflect the trend in consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, as food prices account for nearly one-third of the prices used in calculating the index.
China's consumer inflation grew 0.9 percent year on year in March, as stable prices reinforced the view that the world's second-largest economy is firming up, according to the NBS.
The NBS attributed the lower CPI reading to sharply lowering food prices, which fell 1.9 percent in March. Vegetable prices dropped the most, by 7.9 percent from February.

Commentary: China will not tolerate fake economic data

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has zero tolerance for any fabrication of economic data as it knows the importance of authentic figures in making correct decisions and bringing tangible benefits to its people.
Of the 23 provincial-level regions that have released first quarter regional GDP figures as of Monday, northeast China's Liaoning Province recorded the slowest growth of 2.4 percent, lower than the national growth of 6.9 percent.
This is not a surprise as the local government admitted in January that a raft of economic data had been falsified from 2011 to 2014 and vowed to eliminate the bubbles in statistics.
In response to the problem, Liaoning reported a 2.5-percent drop in its 2016 regional GDP, compared with a 6.7-percent expansion in national GDP, showing the province's firm stance against falsifying data.
The issue of inflated data originates from the obsession some local officials have for impressive figures, which could bring political benefits under previous official evaluation measures.
China is changing to a more scientific evaluation system from the former system, which placed excessive emphasis on economic indicators.
Fake data are even more harmful to society than fake products, as they will distort the central government's judgment about economic realities and influence decision making.
It is also against the Communist Party of China's ideological line, which underscores seeking truth from facts, and erodes the image of the Party in Chinese people's minds.
As in Liaoning's case, the problem can also hurt the people's material well-being, as inflated fiscal figures caused a reduction in the central government's transfer payments to the local level.
The central government has responded to fake data with a definitive "no."
To ensure data authenticity and reliability, the country has unveiled guidelines on the management of statistical work, improved the legal framework and punished economic data-related violations.
"We will never tolerate statistical violations or data falsifications. There will be zero tolerance," head of the National Bureau of Statistics Ning Jizhe said last month.
Last year, the bureau investigated 15 major statistical violation cases, punishing more than 10 people in each case.
The bureau on Thursday set up a law enforcement unit that aims to become a "sharp sword" against data fabrication.
At a time when the whole country is making strides toward the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020, no fake data should be allowed.
After all, China's pledge to "leave no one behind" in building a moderately prosperous society must be fulfilled among the people, not just on paper.

Law revision signals better stock market supervision

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to improve stock market supervision with stricter measures, better information disclosure and strengthened investor protection, said a draft amendment of the Securities Law read by lawmakers on Monday.
The country's securities regulator will be authorized to adopt more measures in law enforcement and impose tougher punishments for violations to better monitor and prevent systemic risks, according to the draft.
Stock exchanges in the meantime will be asked to make more efforts in self-discipline.
The changes are considered a response to a bitter market crash nearly two years ago.
It was the draft's second review by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, two years after the first one. The legislature's ongoing bimonthly session began on Monday and will run until Thursday.
Information disclosure was highlighted in the draft amendment, especially for investors who intend to acquire more than 5 percent of shares of a listed company. Buyers will have to report more, including capital sources, and will be subject to a lock-up period of 18 months, up from the previous half year.
More items were added to curb market manipulation and insider trading, and improve regulation on stock suspension.
In terms of investor protection, small shareholders will be given bigger say, and listed companies should pay dividends according to rules. The draft also included a mechanism of compensation in advance to protect investors who suffer due to illegal activities, such as IPO fraud.
To facilitate the establishment of a multi-level capital market, the draft amendment classified markets into three categories: stock exchanges, the National Equities Exchange and Quotation, and regional equity markets.
There is no revision on stock issuance in the draft amendment, as reform measures to introduce a registration-based IPO system have yet to be released.

China property market to remain stable, competition to intensify: report

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's property sector will remain stable, but competition will intensify as sales slow and liquidity tightens, said a Moody's report on Monday.
China's national contracted property sales will slow from the high level in 2016 but remain within the parameters for a stable outlook, and inventories will remain low in high-tier cities and support property prices, said the report.
However, the report noted that the government's wider implementation of home-purchase restrictions since September 2016 will slow sales and tighten developers' liquidity gradually, leading to more competition.
The competition resulting from slowing sales, and tightening liquidity and regulation will be exacerbated by developers' continued focus on high sales growth in 2017, said the report.
In addition, the report said that developers' focus on large cities has increased competition for land, pushing up land prices and squeezing profit margins.
The report forecast that Chinese government will maintain tight home-purchase controls in cities where property prices are rising rapidly and accommodating policies in cities where inventories are high, as part of its ongoing effort to maintain the stability of the property sector.

PHNOM PENH, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE)'s wholly owned subsidiary Shenzhen Securities Information Co., Ltd and the Bank of China Phnom Penh Branch jointly launched the China-Cambodia cross-border capital services platform and held its first road show event here on Monday.
Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Yim Chhay Ly and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Xiong Bo presided over the launching ceremony.
The platform is aimed "to facilitate the match-making of cross-border investment and financing projects and to promote cross-border capital formation," the press release said.
It added that the Shenzhen Securities Information Co., Ltd and the Bank of China Phnom Penh Branch would make efforts to connect the Chinese capital and Cambodian projects and to diversify cross-border financial service models through information display, road show events, interactive communication and public relation training.
According to the statement, the first road show hosted four Cambodian companies from traditional industries and innovative sectors, covering infrastructure construction, industrial park development, culture and tourism, and Internet new media.
It added that around 100 Cambodian enterprise representatives attended the road show, while 30 professional investment institutions conducted interactive exchanges with the main venue at Shenzhen sub-venue through video connection.
SZSE's chairman Wu Lijun said the China-Cambodia cross-border capital services platform is based on "Science & Technology SMEs Growth Roadmap Plan 2.0" (Tech 2.0 Platform), co-sponsored by the Torch High Technology Industry Development Center and Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and operated by Shenzhen Securities Information Co., Ltd.
He said through video broadcasting systems on computers and mobile phone, the "Tech 2.0 Platform" organizes face-to-face road shows and provides live webcast solutions to match innovative projects with prospective investors beyond boundaries of time and location.
He added that the "Tech 2.0 Platform" has gathered around 4,000 certified professional investment institutions and over 2,000 quality tech projects nationwide with road shows performed on a daily basis.
"With economic, efficient, and transparent investment information sharing features, the platform helps to form an investment and financing eco-system of the private innovative tech companies," he said.
Sou Socheat, director general of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia, said that the platform was a new achievement born from the close relations between Cambodia and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
"SZSE's debut in Cambodia truly reflects its confidence in the Cambodian stock market," he said at the launching ceremony. "Through the event today, I'd like to encourage more cooperation between the Cambodia Securities Exchange and the SZSE."

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China will make unwavering efforts in upgrading its manufacturing industry as the nation transitions to an economy that relies more on innovation and high value-added products.
"China's manufacturing sector is tasked with challenges including a downshift in growth, structural adjustment and a shift in growth engines," said Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology.
He made the remarks when delivering a report submitted to Chinese lawmakers for deliberation at a four-day bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which opened Monday.
China is determined to roll out more policies to optimize the investment environment and tap investment potential of businesses in a bid to support the development of advanced manufacturing, according to the report.
The manufacturing sector will also be bolstered by lowered operation costs by standardizing fee systems, optimizing land supply and streamlining the tax structure, Miao told lawmakers.
In the report, Miao also stressed expanding financing channels for the manufacturing sector and reducing market entry restrictions to make the manufacturing industry more open to foreign investment.
China will aim to improve its innovation system with focus on the research and development of new materials, intelligent manufacturing and robots.

BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), one of the country's biggest lenders, said Monday that it has increased lending to farmers and rural businesses in support of agricultural supply-side structural reform in the first quarter.
The bank's outstanding loans to farmers totaled 1.02 trillion yuan (about 150 billion U.S. dollars) as of the end of March, 76.3 billion yuan more than the level at the beginning of this year, said the ABC.
The ABC has enhanced lending support for large-scale and professional farming and other new types of agribusiness, as well as medium-sized and small rural households, according to the bank.
Nearly 20 million rural households in China borrowed some 858.6 billion yuan in petty loans from the ABC since 2008, it said.
Outstanding agriculture-related loans in China stood at 29.23 trillion as of the end of the first quarter this year, up 8.9 percent year on year, according to the central bank. The growth was 1.8 percentage points higher than the level a quarter ago.

HANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China saw robust growth in the animation box office in 2016 despite a sluggish overall movie market, said a report released Monday at an international animation festival.
Animated movies shown in China last year attracted 220 million viewers with a total box office of 7 billion yuan (1 billion U.S. dollars), up 70.5 percent and 58.9 percent respectively year on year, said the report.
The report, jointly drafted by scholars, directors, screen writers and business managers, was released at the 13th China International Cartoon and Animation Festival in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province.
Zhang Baiqing, honorary head of the China Film Critics Association, led the compilation of the report.
Box office sales in China increased by 3.7 percent in 2016 to 45.71 billion yuan, ending double-digit growth annually since 2003, figures show.
However, animated movies, especially foreign ones, have witnessed rocketing growth in both box office sales and viewer numbers.
Among the total 62 animated films shown last year, 23 foreign movies took in total box office earnings of 4.66 billion yuan with 149 million viewers, up 98.1 percent and 118.1 percent year on year, according to the report.

China's steel industry urged to continue downsizing

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior figure in the Chinese steel industry has called for further cuts to steel capacity, saying the sector remains saturated, despite increased profits and production of steel mills in the first quarter.
"The whole industry needs to press ahead with cutting capacity and de-leveraging," said Gu Jianguo, executive vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA).
He warned against steel price volatility and falling exports in an article published Monday on the CISA website.
Gu's remarks came after unexpectedly strong performance in the steel sector this year.
Thanks to recovery in the broader economy, CISA's members posted combined profits of 23.3 billion yuan (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) during the January-March period, in contrast with a 8.75 billion yuan of losses a year ago.
China's total crude steel output in the same time rose 4.6 percent year on year, with daily production in March hitting a record high.
Encouraged by the the unexpected good news, unfounded optimism is blooming in the oversupplied sector, which Gu describes as "near-sighted."
Highlighting lingering problems, Gu said "more observation is necessary" to forecast the full-year economic outlook, and steel demand and consumption.
Plant managers should be clear-headed, Gu said, asking them not to "blindly increase production."
Officials in a high-level meeting last month agreed steel capacity has not changed fundamentally and the recent price rally could result in vulnerabilities. Capacity cuts are still necessary this year.
Steel production capacity should be cut by around 50 million tonnes and coal by at least 150 million tonnes this year, a key part of supply-side structural reform.
Gu called on steel plants to cooperate with government to eliminate inferior steel products, shut down "zombie enterprises" and curb new capacity.

Interview: China's strong growth ensures stable world economy: economists

SYDNEY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Leading Australian economic experts say China's first quarter economic results have driven the global economy to success.
For the first quarter of 2017, China exceeded expectations, recording a 6.9-percent increase in Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.
The result was incredibly positive according to the James Laurenceson, deputy director of the Australia China Relations Institute at the University of Technology, Sydney, who is also a leading economist.
He told Xinhua on Monday that the figures were well above what was expected, and welcomed by the world.
"More importantly though is that it showed that rebalancing is continuing, with most of the growth coming through consumption, and that is exactly what we wanted to see," Laurenceson said.
Official data released last week showed China's economy has grown 6.7 to 7.2 percent for the last 11 quarters, with this quarter being the strongest growth experienced since the July-September quarter in 2015.
Raymond Yeung, chief economist of Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), believes that not only will China meet its annual 6.5-percent target.
"The past few months have seen the Chinese economy returning to the investment driven model, which works well to stabilize growth despite a lot of global uncertainties," Yeung said.
"Fixed asset investment data soared 9.2 percent year over year in March against market expectations of 8.8 percent."
With China "extraordinarily" accounting for 35 percent of the world's growth, Laurenceson is adamant that China's growth is extremely beneficial and forging a path to economic success, particularly outside of China.
"More Australian goods and more Australian services go to China than other country. That's because incomes in China are growing rapidly, so it's an enormous positive impact to both Australia and the world," Laurenceson said.
Yeung contends that the outperforming Chinese economy has stabilized the entire global economy during current uncertain times, and pointed to the strong growth in China's industry which has, and will continue to be, a boon to the commodity sectors.
"As the factories start to fire their engines again, Chinese demand for commodities will hold up. Investment pipelines will remain strong, underpinning solid commodity demand," Yeung said.
There is one project in particular that Yeung believes best demonstrates China's ambition to generate, and cultivate, further domestic demand and spur future growth, the Xiong'an New Area, another new area of national significance after the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area.
"The infrastructure build-out will eventually cover 2,000 square-km, a size similar to Shenzhen's. The scale will be massive," Yeung said.
With the increased infrastructure spend in the works, Laurenceson is certain this will lead to better outcomes for China, the Asia-Pacific region and the world, in particular, Australia.
"A lot of Australian commodities feed into China's manufacturing sector, so when we see China's industrial production go up, infrastructure spend up, doing well, that is a positive story for Australia," Laurenceson said.
With China's exports rocketing up by 14.8 percent, and imports an impressive 31.1 percent, Laurenceson believes that this robust result could not have come at a more critical time.
"Globally, trade has been suffering and slowing down. China is the world's largest trading nation, it is the world's second largest economy, and is growing at one of the fastest rates in the world," Laurenceson said.
"So whenever you have such a significant economy experiencing robust trade growth, that's excellent for the global economy too."

China Focus: Shoe businesses innovate amid rising costs

FUZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Rising production costs have mounted pressure on Jayanta Ghosh, a Bangladesh footwear dealer, to leave the world's largest shoe-making base in China, where he has lived for five years.
"If the costs keep rising, in two to three years I will have to look for a place where I can find cheaper supplies," he said.
Ghosh is a quality control manager from Bangladesh footwear giant Papella. He represents his company, purchasing footwear supplies in Jinjiang, eastern China's Fujian Province. For more than ten years, Papella bought raw materials from China and made shoes in Bangladesh.
"The food here is similar to what I have in my hometown Dacca: rice, fish and vegetables," said Ghosh, who enjoys his life in the Chinese city and is reluctant to leave.
Ghosh said that five years ago, the cost of materials for a pair of canvas shoes was 5 U.S. dollars. The shoes sell for 6 dollars in Bangladesh.
"Now the price remains unchanged, but the cost has risen to 5.5 dollars. The profit of a pair was cut by half," he said.
Jinjiang is world's largest production base for sneakers, with 404 large-scale enterprises producing 1 billion pairs of shoes a year.
With rising labor costs, shoe makers in Jinjiang have been scrambling to grab the high-end market. Big Chinese shoe companies based in Jinjiang, including ANTA and 361 Degrees, have signed NBA basketball stars like Kevin Garnett and Klay Thompson, and Jamaican athletes to promote their brands internationally.
The transformation from low price goods to premium brands is not easy. In addition to increased costs in labor and raw materials such as rubber and petroleum products, the exported goods price index of footwear products at the end of last year dropped 10 percent from 2015. The foreign trade climate index for the shoe business fell by 24 percent during the same period, according to the Jinjiang city bureau of commerce.
Despite the difficulties, Jinjiang's shoe business is still prosperous as seen from the Jinjiang Footwear & Sports International Industry Exposition, one of the world's largest, which closed Saturday, where more than 2,000 standard booths were fully occupied. A new shoe and textile wholesale complex opened at the expo, with 90 percent of the 2,113 stores for rent open.
Ashraf Uddin, a Bangladeshi businessman, said he hoped to find Chinese partners at the expo.
Wu Shaoqing, general manager of the Chuanda footwear company, told Xinhua that Chinese footwear enterprises needed to upgrade and innovate.
"To survive, we must follow the changes in demand, and development of society," he said.
In the past, the Chinese firm mostly sold handmade Chinese black and white shoes. Starting from 2015, Wu invited designers, giving them 10,000 yuan (1,453 U.S. dollars) to develop a new shoe design.
The company also set up a footwear processing factory in Vietnam, where labor costs are 20 percent lower than that in China. It sends the shoes back to China for sale.
According to Cai Wenqing, head of the Jinjiang commerce bureau, many companies did similarly and invested more in research and development to buffer against the impact of rising costs.
"Transformation takes time, but with their active response we will be on the right track soon," he said.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance regulator on Sunday flashed red alert on risks facing the industry.
Insurance companies must guard against liquidity risks with regular cash flow tests, noted a circular issued by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
They must follow and analyze changes in the macro-economy, stock and bond markets, noted the document.
"A prudent investment scheme must be established to strengthen asset and liability management and to avoid using return on investment as the only investment goal and performance indicator," it added.
Insurers must also improve capital management and prevent capital from being used for other purposes. Internal risk control systems must be improved, the CIRC stressed.
China's financial regulators have recently strengthened oversight and issued stiffer punishments to remedy shortcomings and promote efficiency.
China's top anti-graft authority earlier this month announced that Xiang Junbo, chairman of the CIRC, was being investigated on suspicion of a serious violation of the code of conduct of the Communist Party of China.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom, a Chinese telecom giant, witnessed a surge in net profits in Q1, on the back of innovation efforts.
The company made 274 million yuan (about 40 million U.S. dollars) net profit in the first three months, up 88.3 percent year-on-year, according to its first quarter report released over the weekend.
Facing fierce competition, the Shanghai-listed company saw fast growth of its businesses such as cloud computing, video and Internet of Things, offsetting waning revenue from fixed-line voice business.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Su Tongqiang and his ceramics company in eastern China's Shandong Province have bid farewell to the wafer-thin profit margins.
"Years ago, my company made meager profits of less than 2,000 yuan (about 290 U.S. dollars) for more than 70,000 cups in one shipping container sent overseas," Su said.
"Climbing the value chain was the only way to survive," said the entrepreneur, who owes his company's a grand comeback to years of research and development. The company now holds more than a hundred patents.
"Profits from one expensive cup are equivalent to dozens of cheap ones," Su said.
Su's company's transition is testimony to China's broader economic restructuring.
VALUABLE TRANSITION
China is moving toward an economy based on innovation and services, reducing reliance on investment and exports of low value-added goods.
"China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth continues," the World Bank said in a report earlier this month, noting that economic growth will continue to moderate as capacity is cut and credit kept on a tight leash.
Su's company's revenue grew 30 percent in Q1. The string of upbeat data in the first quarter also pointed to a firming in the broader economy and progress in economic restructuring, giving policymakers some room to maneuver.
GDP growth in Q1 stood at 6.9 percent, up slightly from 6.8 percent in the previous quarter, with 77.2 percent of it driven by consumption, 12.6 percentage points higher than the 2016 level. The service sector rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, out-pacing a 3-percent increase in agriculture and 6.4 percent in secondary industries.
"Consumption is playing a more prominent role in driving growth, evidence of progress in economic restructuring ," said Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council, China's cabinet.
Innovation is critical to Su's and other Chinese businesses' ascent of the value chain, an uphill battle they have to fight as improved salaries and living conditions for China's workers have allowed other countries to occupy the market for low-end products such as shoes and toys once cornered by China. Industrial output growth in the hi-tech manufacturing sector reached 13.4 percent in Q1, outstripping the 6.8-percent registered across all industrial companies.
The domestic wave of innovation and start-ups means new business and new consumption, according to Mao Shengyong with the National Bureau of Statistics.
LONG TO-DO LIST
China still has a long list of reform tasks, many intertwined with one another, which when added to global risks like U.S. interest rate increases and protectionism makes policy-making tricky, analysts said.
"China needs to remain on the alert," cautioned Li Wei, head of the DRC.
China should continue to reduce excess capacity, curb credit, lower debt leverage in the corporate sector and reform state-owned enterprises, said Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region.
The view is echoed by Zhang of DRC, who said that policy should focus on cutting overcapacity, reducing inventories, deleveraging, lowering costs and strengthening weak links to generate long-term growth and meet new consumer demand.
"Supply-side structural reform can force Chinese businesses to increase their competitiveness and improve overall growth quality, although the process will be painful," said Cai Zhizhou of Peking University.

MACAO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Macao has simplified and improved some of its regulations for trade and investment promotion, the special administrative region's investment promotion body said on Sunday.
Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (MTIPI) said it has updated the regulations for companies attending promotional events, especially cut short the list of documents that should be provided for companies to hold or participate in promotional activities such as exhibitions or forums.
Instead, such information will be provided by other government departments such as Financial Services Bureau, the institute said.
According to MTIPI, companies now don't need to hand registration copy for business opening or modification, commerce registration copy, business tax form copy, occupational tax form copy, and certificate copy for no outstanding tax.
The regulation updates also said the exhibition information should be issued to public every month, which will help companies and interested visitors know the promotional activities as soon as possible.
Such information was publicized every June and December per year, according to oldspider regulations.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Profits of Ping An Bank, a leading Chinese commercial bank, grew in the first quarter with its asset quality on the mend.

Chinese banks face profitability pressure: Moody's

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese listed banks were confronted with profitability pressure from the country's slowing economic growth, despite the absence of any significant deterioration in reported asset performance, said Moody's Investors Service.
"At the same time, the banks' capitalization and liquidity positions remained stable overall, but weakened among the smaller entities due to their faster rate of asset growth," the global rating agency said in a latest report.
The 11 state-owned and joint-stock commercial banks including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reported average loan growth of 12 percent in 2016, faster than the 10-percent in 2015, while the national joint-stock commercial banks continued to grow their loans faster than the major state-owned peers.
The reported asset performance for these 11 banks remained largely stable last year, it said.
"The banks' stable reported asset performance came despite our view that current asset risks remain biased to the downside because of rising corporate leverage and strong mortgage growth amid rapid house price appreciation," Moody's said.
Profitability remained under pressure throughout the year, as reflected in a continued decline in the banks' return on average assets (RoA), due to factors including a further narrowing in net interest margins, with the RoA for the 11 banks dropping to 1.05 percent in 2016 from 1.15 percent a year ago, it said.
The Chinese economy expanded 6.7 percent in 2016, its slowest growth in a quarter of a century.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Vadim Filimonov, an Estonia PhD student at the Law School of Renmin University of China, is playing his own role in bring Russia and China closer together. Helping translate business letters and legal documents, he works part time at the Chinese agricultural company Dongzhankebo.
Filimonov is one of a number of students who has secured his job through the new talent program "Cirrus Project" initiated by the Zhonguangcun "Belt and Road" Industrial Promotion Association (ZBRA).
At a panel discussion at the weekend in Beijing, Filimonov said that for business ties between Chinese and Russian companies to succeed, both sides have to learn about each other's legal systems, something strained with difficulty.
In Russia, there are very detailed laws and regulations in agriculture, Filimonov said, especially when it comes to cutting-edge agricultural technologies which Chinese companies are now engaged in.
Recognizing Filimonov's work, Xiu Yanling, assistant general manager of Dongzhankebo, said at a panel discussion that thanks to such exchange students as Filimonov from countries along the Belt and Road, the company's cooperation with its Russian partners has been fairly smooth so far.
Dongzhankebo has planned to develop organic agriculture in the Russian Far East and has already leased an initial 667 square kilometer of farmland in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast of Russia, one of the countries along the Belt and Road.
Dongzhankebo and Filomonov is merely the beginning. In the future, plenty more students will benefit from the the "Cirrus Project" that is meant to establish a platform to provide talent for Chinese enterprises, products and services to go global under the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as to offer foreign students opportunities to train and work in Chinese companies.
The program was launched in late March by ZBRA, an association founded in 2016 by high-tech firms and research institutes in Beijing's hi-tech heartland Zhongguanchun Technology Park. There are more than 7,000 high-tech companies in the area dubbed as "China's Silicon Valley."
Recalling the scene at the Cirrus Project's inaugural job fair on March 23, Wang Ying, director of the Office of International Students at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), said after the panel disucssion that the event was held under a "warm atmosphere" and that the 29 participating companies received over 300 resumes.
Foreign students in BIT, one of first universities to take part in the Cirrus Project, are from 122 countries altogether, among which over 40 are along the Belt and Road. The university has seen an annual increase of 30 percent in the number of enrolled foreign students since 2014, one year after the Belt and Road Initiative was put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping, said Wang after the panel discussion.
The Initiative aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road trading routes, leading to mutually beneficial economic outcomes for every nation it reaches.
BIT's strategy, Wang said, is to train foreign students who end up playing a leadership role in executing cooperation projects in their home countries.
The Cirrus Project can help foreign students not only become familiar with policy and business environment in China, but also, more importantly, develop personal affection for the country, Wang added.
Zhang Xiaodong, president of ZBRA, has said the Cirrus Project is expected to attract more than 10,000 foreign students in the next five years. Such students are important bridges connecting China and other Belt and Road countries.

(Xinhua/Yin Bogu)
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is on track to reach its growth target of around 6.5 percent this year with financial risks "well under control," the country's central bank chief said on Friday.
"The strong momentum has been maintained in the first quarter of 2017. The gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.9 percent year-on-year and inflation by 1.4 percent," Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said in a statement.
The statement was released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on its website for a meeting of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC).
"As the growth of investment and trade stabilized and recovered, consumption grew steadily, and employment remained broadly stable. The expected 6.5 percent growth for this year is within reach," he said.
Zhou said China is "fully confident" about preventing and eliminating systemic financial risks, as the profitability of industrial enterprises has improved significantly and the banking sector's capital and provisions remain adequate.
"The corporate and the financial sectors are broadly resilient, with risks well under control," he said.
Going forward, monetary policy will remain "prudent and neutral," striking a better balance between stabilizing growth and the task of deleveraging, preventing asset bubbles, and containing the accumulation of systemic risks, the central bank governor said.
Zhou reiterated that the Chinese government will continue to "push forward reforms on all fronts," including reforms in the financial sector, the fiscal and taxation system, and the state-owned enterprises, as well as addressing excess capacity in the coal, steel and other industries.
In terms of IMF reforms, Zhou said the IMF should continue to advance the quota and governance reform to ensure that the institution remains quota-based and adequately resourced.
"The 2010 quota and governance reform has not significantly closed the gaps between the actual and calculated quotas, and between members' calculated quota shares and their actual weights in the global economy," he said.
The IMF should also continue to promote the reform of the international monetary system, Zhou said, noting "globalization calls louder for a more stable international monetary system."
He believed that the IMF's reform of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket has laid a good foundation for reserve currency diversification, contributing to the stability of the international monetary system.
Last year, the IMF included the Chinese currency, the Renminbi (RMB), into the SDR basket as a fifth currency. It's the first time for the IMF to include a currency from an emerging market economy in its elite reserve currency basket.
"We support the IMF's work on broadening the role of the SDR, and expect more targeted and sustained efforts from the perspective of addressing the inherent weaknesses in the existing international monetary system," Zhou said.
Yi Gang, deputy governor of the PBOC, also said on Friday that China's central bank could play a role in promoting the wider use of SDR, noting China has started reporting foreign reserves and international balance of payment data in SDR.
He suggested that market institutions could increase the use of SDR as an accounting unit, which could encourage their participation in the SDR market and inject more liquidity into the market.

WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, could play a role in promoting the wider use of Special Drawing Rights (SDR), said Yi Gang, deputy governor of the PBOC, on Friday.
The use of SDR as a unit of account, financial instruments and official reserves has shown progress since the Chinese currency, the Renminbi, joined the SDR basket last year, said Yi at a forum during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Spring Meetings.
According to the deputy governor, China has started reporting foreign reserves and international balance of payment data in SDR; and the World Bank and Standard Chartered have successfully issued SDR bonds in China.
However, Yi pointed out that the infrastructure for the SDR market needs improvement because the market still lacks liquidity, and the costs for hedging and settlements remain high.
In order to promote SDR market liquidity, Yi suggested that market institutions could increase the use of SDR as an accounting unit, which could encourage their participation in the SDR market and inject more liquidity into the market.
Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor for Allianz, at the same forum also suggested that multilateral banks, sovereign wealth funds and multinational companies could be potential players in the SDR market.
In terms of official SDR reserves, Yi said that the IMF has played an important role in SDR allocation, while other central banks of countries that issue the reserve currency could also play a role in facilitating other SDR reserve holders to convert their SDR assets into other reserve currency assets. In this regard, China's central bank could also play a role, said Yi.
The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement its member countries' official reserves. It can be exchanged among governments for freely usable currencies in times of need.
Last year, the IMF decided to include the RMB in the SDR basket as a fifth currency. It's the first time for the IMF to include a currency from an emerging market economy in its SDR basket.
It is an acknowledgement of the progress China has made to get integrated into a global financial system dominated for decades by advanced economies, marking a historic milestone for China, the IMF and the international monetary system.

Digital transformation to accelerate China's manufacturing growth: report

Editor: Mu Xuequan
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Digital transformation will significantly increase Chinese manufacturers' overall competitiveness and accelerate productivity growth, a report showed.
With digital transformation, China's manufacturing productivity can achieve annual growth of 6.5 percent over the next 15 years, bridging its productivity gap with developed countries in the next 20 years, according to a report released by consulting firm McKinsey & Company Friday.
Of the 130 Chinese manufacturers polled, 76 percent believed that the "Industry 4.0 strategy" will increase their competitiveness, leading to revenue and cost improvements of at least 15 percent.
The number surpassed the 57-percent and 50-percent of their American and German counterparts, indicating higher level of optimism of Chinese manufacturers over what an industrial upgrade could bring.
The so-called "Industry 4.0 strategy," similar to China's "Made in China 2025" plan, promotes digital-enabled operational transformation to elevate the manufacturing sector up the value chain.
Despite Chinese companies' willingness for industrial upgrades, many are still not ready to implement the strategies, according to the report.
Only 57 percent of Chinese firms polled said they're prepared for digital transformation, compared with 71 percent in the United States and 68 percent in Germany.
"One of the biggest challenge for Chinese manufacturers is their lack of a systematic approach to implementing such initiatives," said Arthur Wang, partner at Mckinsey & Company.
Only 6 percent of Chinese companies have a clear roadmap for digitalization, contrasting 33 percent of companies in the United States and 35 percent in Germany.
To address the issues, Mckinsey & Company collaborated with Tsinghua University to set up a digital capability center in Beijing on Friday, hoping the display of digitalized assembly lines and supply chain management tools in the center will give Chinese firms an idea of how to improve their business.
"Every company, even those most successful, needs to upgrade itself to capture the opportunities presented by disruptive revolutions. The digital capability center answers the call for such changes," said Joe Ngai, managing partner of McKinsey Greater China.
China announced the "Made in China 2025" blueprint in 2015 as a way to move manufacturing up in the value chain, promoting development in 10 key sectors such as medical devices and robotics. Authorities have promised "multi-pronged financial support" to implement the strategy.

URUMQI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a section of the Beijing-Urumqi Expressway in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region started on Friday, local authorities said.
The Wutongdaquan-Mulei expressway is the last section on the Beijing-Urumqi Expressway in the region.
The section measures about 515 km with four lanes. At a cost of 17.8 billion yuan (2.6 billion U.S. dollars), the work is scheduled to take three years when the expressway will be complete, said Wang Tingwu, an official with the regional transport department.
Li Hongbin, deputy director of the department, said the expressway will be a major link between China's inland regions, Central Asia and Europe and will also support the construction of the northern slope of Tianshan economic belt.
The Beijing-Urumqi Expressway stretching across the northern and northwestern of China will boost the exploitation of regional mineral resources and tourism.

Beijing to regulate thriving bike-sharing industry

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing authorities are considering measures to regulate the ubiquitous shared bikes that benefited commuters but challenge urban management.
Beijing began to solicit pubic opinion Friday on a draft rule that will cap the number of shared bikes on the city's streets and promise orderly parking.
The bike-sharing business, which took off in big Chinese cities less than two years ago, allows riders to hire bikes for as little as one yuan (about 15 U.S. cents) per hour via a mobile app and drop them off anywhere for the next users.
The service has helped riders evade Beijing's chronic traffic congestion and cut auto emissions, while haphazardly parked bikes have marred the city's image and blocked roads.
The draft rule requires district governments to set an upper limit for shared bikes in their respective jurisdictions. It says parking zones should be established around transportation hubs, shopping areas and office blocks.
Shared bikes must have GPS devices. The city's transport authorities are working on a technical specification.
In addition, the rule forbids children under the age of 12 from riding shared bikes and bans the idea of shared electric bikes "for a while."
Bike-sharing startups, such as Mobike, Ofo and Bluegogo, have put nearly 700,000 two-wheelers in Beijing, securing nearly 11 million users.
There were 18.9 million users of shared bicycles nationwide in 2016. The number is expected to hit 50 million by the end of 2017.

BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- E-payment method has been growing dramatically in China, changing Chinese people's life and coming out with tourists to other countries, such as Thailand.
Thailand has been the hot destination for Chinese tourists in recent years and China the largest source of group visitors to Thailand.
WeChat Pay, one of the most popular payment methods in China, thus followed the steps of Chinese tourists into Thailand.
During the Songkran festival this year, which is the high season for Chinese tourists to visit Thailand, many Chinese tourists were seen use WeChat Pay in convenience stores, duty-free shops, restaurants and even massage parlors, no matter in Chiang Mai, Phuket or capital Bangkok.
"I don't need to take my wallet out, I don't need to wait for change, there is some discount and no commission, the payment method has so many advantages," said Liu, a woman from Beijing, while shopping in King Power's Bangkok Downtown Complex.
"That we have WeChat Pay here means we can get access to the huge population using WeChat, the most popular social media in China, and it will drive our sales to go up," said Kuang Wei, King Power's manager overseeing the international market.
Kuang said e-payment was introduced to the store at the beginning of 2016. Although only 20 percent to 30 percent of payments are paid by e-payment methods, e-payment is growing quickly as the store has many Chinese customers who are already used to use these methods to pay.
A Thai restaurant called Thevaros, where WeChat Pay was introduced 14 months ago, in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, told Xinhua that their revenue increased some 50 percent after introducing WeChat Pay.
When compared with traditional payments by credit or debit cards, Yin Jie, who is in charge of WeChat Pay's overseas service, said e-payment can help sellers to communicate with their customers and improve their service according to feedback from customers, which is a big advantage.
According to WeChat Pay, the transaction volume in Thailand grew dramatically during the Chinese lunar new year and Thai new year Songkran in 2017.
Yin told Xinhua that WeChat Pay's overseas service focus only on Chinese tourists now, as the service is available in 12 countries and regions such as South Korea, Japan, Canada, China's Taiwan.
"We may extend our service to the Thai market in the long term," Yin said.

China's outstanding loans to small business rise in Q1

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Outstanding loans to China's small business continued to grow in Q1, official data showed on Friday.
Outstanding loans to small business had totaled 21.9 trillion yuan (3.2 trillion U.S. dollars) at the end of March, up 17 percent from a year ago, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement.
The growth was faster than that recorded by bigger businesses, the central bank said.
Small business loans account for nearly one third of total outstanding loans, 1.7 percentage points higher than a year ago.
The government is encouraging banks to support small businesses, which often have difficulty obtaining bank loans.
The banking regulator has differential regulatory policies to improve the coverage of loans for small businesses and reduce their financing costs.

Economic Watch: Listed companies' Q1 reports paint firming economic picture

Editor: An
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The advance first-quarter reports from Chinese listed companies reinforced the message, conveyed in the recent string of upbeat economic data, that the world's second-largest economy is on steadier footing.
As of Wednesday, 1,432 Chinese listed companies had disclosed their advance first-quarter reports, and 66 percent of them registered a net profit growth or turned losses into gains, according to data compiled by Wind, a leading information service provider.
Breakdown figures showed that 443 companies will witness a year-on-year profit surge of more than 50 percent in the first quarter, with 289 companies to report year-on-year profit growth of less than 50 percent and 155 companies to reverse business losses.
Industry-specific data revealed that most companies in both traditional sectors such as coal and steel as well as some newly emerging industries posted stellar growth on the back of business improvement or product price increases.
Among the 11 listed coal-related companies that have released advance first-quarter reports, all have registered net profit growth of more than 100 percent except for Inner Mongolia Pingzhuang Energy Resources.
Yanzhou Coal Mining Company is forecast to see net profit growth of more than 580 percent in the first three months this year due to rising coal prices and expanded output.
The profit growth of coal-related listed companies will likely continue into the following quarters as coal prices stay elevated, according to a report from Industrial Securities, a domestic brokerage house.
China's manufacturing sector in March stayed above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row, with traditional sectors like oil refining, coking and metal smelting witnessing robust growth, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
"China's manufacturing sector and the broader economy are likely to continue steady growth on the back of favorable macroeconomic conditions and rebounding foreign markets demand," investment bank China International Capital Corporation said in a research note.
In a similar vein, all 15 Chinese listed iron and steel companies that released advance first-quarter reports predicted net profit growth, with Sansteel Minguang registering a net profit of around 400 million yuan (58.1 million U.S. dollars), a year-on-year surge of more than 800 percent.
Despite new moves to curb housing market speculation in major Chinese cities, the iron and steel prices are buttressed by robust fixed-asset investment growth in China's transport infrastructure, analysts said.
China is set to spend around 2.6 trillion yuan on transport infrastructure projects this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
China's major industrial companies registered robust profit growth in the first two months of the year, and NBS statistician He Ping attributed this to increased industrial production, raw material price increases and an uptick in profitability.
"Profit margins of some major types of steel products have hit the record high since 2011," Industrial Securities said in a research note.
China is seeking to transition to an innovation and service-driven economy from one heavily reliant on investment and exports of low-value-added goods, and advance first-quarter reports showed that some new growth engines are picking up momentum.
Listed companies on the tech-heavy small and medium-sized enterprises board will witness an average year-on-year net profit growth of 66.6 percent in the first quarter, Shenwan Hongyuan Securities data showed, with new energy vehicle-related shares among the best performers.
Not every figure was good news. Of 232 listed companies that have released their formal first-quarter reports, 122 of them reported higher debt levels, according to Wind data.
"It is a crucial moment for some listed companies, especially those smaller companies pressured by rising debt against the backdrop of the U.S. interest rate increase and rising capital costs at home," said Li Huiyong, economist at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks closed mixed in roller coaster trading on Friday, with the Shanghai market recovering from losses at the end of the trading day.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.03 percent at 3,173.15 points, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.43 percent lower at 10,314.35 points.
Total turnover on the two bourses stood at 382.5 billion yuan (55.6 billion U.S. dollars), down from 464.9 billion yuan on the previous trading day.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, ended 0.62 percent lower at 1,839.01 points.
The Shanghai index fell in the afternoon trading session as profit-taking in Xiongan-related stocks and tighter regulatory scrutiny weighed on investor sentiment.
Xiongan-related stocks tumbled after a senior government official warned against speculation in property and stocks.
On April 1, China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone spanning three counties in Hebei Province. The new area, some 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, is expected to help address the "urban ills" of traffic congestion and air pollution in Beijing by curbing the capital's population growth and moving non-capital functions out of Beijing.
Investors were also dampened by tighter liquidity concerns as the government intensified the battle against speculative trading and riskier financial practices.
Top securities regulator Liu Shiyu last weekend urged stock exchanges to "brandish their sword" and punish market misbehavior "without mercy."
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has been toughening supervision and punishment of illegal market activities such as insider trading and stock manipulation after the market rout in 2015 shattered investor confidence.
The CSRC slapped a 3.47 billion yuan fine on a company chairman in March for stock market manipulation, a record high.
However, the index was buoyed by shares related to medical treatment, the banking sector as well as iron and steel by the end of daily trading.

China opens new freight train service to Moscow

XIAMEN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A new freight train service started on Friday linking the east China port city of Xiamen with Moscow, making it the newest China-Europe freight train route.
At 9:30 a.m., the train with 40 containers left the station from Xiamen Free Trade Zone carrying goods worth 363,000 U.S. dollars including granite, lighting supplies, artificial flowers and shoes for Moscow.
A single trip on the 10,920-km route takes 13 to 14 days. Without the direct train service, it used to take at least 25 days to transport goods.
The train route connects the east and northeast Chinese cities of Nanchang, Nanjing, Jinan and Jinzhou, and crosses the border via Manzhouli Port in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
Jiang Jingdong, assistant general manager of Xiamen Haicang Free Trade Port Zone Investment and Construction Management Co. Ltd., said the service is still in trial operations with three trips from Xiamen to Moscow per month. The freight train service will be normalized in the second half of this year.
Huang Changhong, manager of Trans-China Logistics Co.,Ltd., said that trade between Xiamen and Russia is complementary. Xiamen and its surrounding cities are export-oriented with machinery equipment and shoemaking industries, while it imports wood, paper pulp and vegetable oil from Russia.
Lin Jiangfan, an official with Xiamen Haicang Free Trade Port Zone, said that as the host city of the 2017 BRICS Summit slated for September, Xiamen welcomes a closer partnership with Russia, one of the BRICS countries. The Xiamen-Moscow freight train service could also strengthen the Belt and Road Initiative, driving trade in Xiamen.
In 2016, exports from Xiamen to Russia reached more than 5 billion yuan (727 million U.S. dollars), and imports from Russia totaled 1.9 billion yuan.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to renew anti-dumping duties on imports of optical fiber from the United States and the European Union for another five years as oldspider taxes expired a year ago.
If tariffs are halted, U.S. and EU producers, still confronted with huge idle capacity and sluggish domestic sectors, are very likely to boost their exports again, which will cause damage to China's optical fiber market, the Ministry of Commerce said Friday in a statement.
Previous tax rates will be maintained, ranging from 4.7 percent to 29.1 percent based on the dumping margin.
The new duties will become effective on Saturday.
China is the world's largest and fastest-growing market for dispersion unshifted single-mode optical fiber, accounting for more than 60 percent of global demand.
The optical fiber affected is largely used in the telecommunications industry.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The central parity rate of the Chinese currency renminbi, or the yuan, weakened 31 basis points to 6.8823 against the U.S. dollar Friday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The country's forex regulator stressed on Thursday that pressure from capital flight had eased markedly as firmer economic growth renewed foreign investment and the yuan steered clear of depreciation.
In the first quarter, banks' net forex sales stood at 40.9 billion U.S. dollars, down 67 percent from a year ago, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
Forex reserves also rose in March for the second month to 3.0091 trillion U.S. dollars, the first back-to-back increase since April 2016. In January, reserves slipped below the 3-trillion-dollar mark.
In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.
The central parity rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) announced enhanced supervision over insurance companies to prevent risks.
The insurance sector should guard against liquidity risks, corporate governance problems and insolvency issues that prevail in some insurance companies, warned the CIRC in a statement on Thursday.
The commission urged regulators to strictly supervise administrative permissions, information disclosure and penalties to improve the weak links in the system.
China's financial regulators have recently strengthened oversight and issued harsher punishments to remedy shortcomings and promote efficiency, in a sweeping campaign to protect against systemic financial crisis, a key task outlined by the country's leadership.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank continued its net cash injections via open market operations on Friday, the fourth straight day after a halt on Monday.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 100 billion yuan (about 14.5 billion U.S. dollars) of reverse repos, a process by which the central bank purchases securities from banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
The injection saw a net 40 billion yuan pumped into the market today, offset by 60 billion yuan in maturing reverse repos.
The operations included 60 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repo prices to yield 2.45 percent, 20 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent, and 20 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
China's monetary policy in 2017 is set to be "prudent and neutral," keeping appropriate liquidity levels and avoiding large injections.

WELLINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies Friday signalled their support for the New Zealand tourism sector with agreements made through Christchurch Airport.
China Southern Airlines has joined the Christchurch-based University of Canterbury (UC) in a new partnership which will benefit one of the South Island's most popular scenic attractions.
The airline signed an agreement to become as an official partner of the iconic University of Canterbury Mount John Observatory, New Zealand's pre-eminent optical research observatory, which sits at the heart of the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve.
The partnership also supported tourism in Tekapo, an alpine lakeside resort, with 10 percent of the agreement's funding provided to the Mackenzie District Council for tourism infrastructure in Tekapo.
"China Southern Airlines is showing a real commitment in this partnership to enhance the visitor experience at Tekapo," Mackenzie District Council Mayor Graham Smith said in a statement.
UC vice-chancellor Rod Carr said he hoped the partnership with China Southern Airlines is a sign of strong ties between the two countries.
"China is the largest and fastest growing international market for student recruitment at UC, so strengthening relationships with key organizations there will support that growth and provide students with employment opportunities," Carr said in the statement.
"This sponsorship is a direct show of support for an area Chinese visitors love to visit." Christchurch Airport chief executive Malcolm Johns said in a statement.
China Southern Airlines Australasian managing director Louis Lu said it was a meaningful partnership that benefited both tourism and science.
"We all share an interest in discovering more about the amazing space that is the sky. China Southern explores it from an aviation perspective, the team at UC and the observatory research its secrets and showcase the amazing stargazing opportunities it offers," Lu said in the statement.
The observatory enables UC staff and students to carry out cutting-edge astronomical research in a number of different areas, including the search for extra-solar planets, the tracking of near-earth objects and the study of pulsating, variable and exploding stars.
Christchurch Airport also announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Alibaba, the world's largest retail commerce company, to connect small and regional New Zealand businesses with Chinese visitors.
Chinese travellers would be able to use the Alibaba Group apps to plan their visit, while they toured New Zealand, including shopping and financial transactions, and after they returned to China.
Johns said the strategic partnership was pivotal to unlocking for New Zealand's regions the power of Alibaba's international ambition to have 2 billion consumers in micro trading relationships with tens of millions of businesses around the world by 2026.
"This agreement has the potential to super-charge regional development across New Zealand, by unlocking micro exporting using tourism as the basis for the first meeting between the parties," he said.

Chinese businesses' outbound M&A slows in first quarter

Editor: Mu Xuequan
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese businesses' overseas investment slowed in Q1 as regulators stepped in to contain reckless growth in the sector, according to a report by auditing company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
Chinese businesses reported 142 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals overseas in Q1, down 39 percent from Q1 last year.
In value terms, China's outbound M&A came in at 21.2 billion U.S. dollars, down 77 percent year on year,the PwC report said.
Chen Chao with PwC attributed the slowdown to Chinese regulators' tightening requirements on overseas investments and rising uncertainties worldwide.
Earlier data from PwC showed China's outbound M&A soared 246 percent by value to 221 billion dollars in 2016, more than the previous four years combined.
Noting an "irrational tendency" in outbound investment, Chinese authorities have set stricter rules and advised companies to make their investment decisions more carefully.
At a press conference on the sidelines of the annual parliamentary session last month, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the country is seeing overheated and hasty outbound investment in industries such as sports and entertainment that does little for China's economy and is not welcomed abroad.
While promising efforts to contain the trend, Zhou reiterated the government stance of supporting and encouraging businesses to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation between China and other countries.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China remains the top destination for venture capital (VC) investment in Asia, with 3.6 billion U.S. dollars invested in Q1, accounting firm KPMG said in a report.
The volume increased by 100 million dollars from the previous quarter, according to the report on VC investment trends.
KPMG pointed out that investors in Asia were cautious, with a noticeable decline in the total number of deals, down from 403 in Q4 to 258.
Among a number of unicorns, China's bike-sharing platform ofo raised 450 million dollars, the largest bike-sharing investment on record.
Other fundraisings in China in the global top 10 were 600 million dollars for electric vehicle startup NIO, 360 million dollars for courier Hive Box Technology and 350 million dollars going to video sharing and live broadcasting app developer Kuaishou Technology.
In terms of sectors, the first quarter saw a significant amount of interest in medtech globally, particularly in the United States, Israel and Canada. The Asian medtech market has yet to achieve a strong presence, the report noted, but the potential is significant given the large consumer base.
Tech areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, cognitive learning and robotics are expected to continue to receive strong attention. Healthcare technology, fintech, and e-commerce are also expected to be strong sectors in Asia in Q2 and beyond, according to the report.

BERLIN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's luxury automaker BMW posted a better-than-expected pre-tax profit for the first quarter of 2017 on Thursday, driven by a rise in earnings from its Chinese joint venture and positive valuation effects.
The Munich-based automaker reported a pre-tax profit of 3 billion euros (3.23 billion U.S. dollars) for the first three months, surging 27 percent compared to the same period in 2016.
BMW's jump in profits was largely driven by a one-off revaluation of its stake in the mapping service HERE as well as higher profit from its operation in China.
Revenues climbed by 12.4 percent to 23.45 billion euros in the reporting period.
But its EBIT margin (profit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues) in the automotive segment -- a key indicator of profitability -- sank to 9.0 percent in the first quarter, compared to 9.4 percent a year ago.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China launched a week of campaigns to raise awareness of protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) Thursday.
The campaign, jointly organized by 23 agencies, will feature events across the country, including press conferences, forums, lectures and the release of a whitepaper on judicial protection of IPR, running up to April 26, World Intellectual Property Day.
Addressing the opening ceremony, State Councilor Wang Yong said that China needs sound IPR protection to foster innovation. Wang also called for better international IPR cooperation in creating an inclusive and open environment for innovation.
China has become the largest source of patent applications, trademarks and industrial designs, said Francis Gurry, director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
The number of Chinese international patent applications filed under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty exceeded 43,000 last year, up 44.7 percent, according to the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO).
IPR authorities had handled over 80,000 cases involving patents, trademarks and copyrights, said Shen Changyu, head of the SIPO.
In the first quarter this year, more than 2 million pirated publications were seized, said a joint statement issued Thursday by China's National Office Against Pornographic and Illegal Publications and the National Copyright Administration.
China also launched a national copyright monitoring website Thursday, which would provide 24/7 monitoring of the Internet and identify suspected rights infringements.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday set up a law enforcement unit under its statistics bureau to handle data falsification cases.
The new enforcement unit, established under the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), will prevent, investigate and punish data fabrication, according to a statement on the NBS website.
A provincial official admitted in January that from 2011 to 2014, economic data from the northeast province of Liaoning had been riddled with false information.
Days after the revelation, Ning Jizhe, head of the NBS, defended the accuracy of national data, saying the NBS had adopted measures to ensure the authenticity and reliability of statistics.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's tax revenue grew faster in Q1, official data showed on Thursday.
The tax authority collected 3.33 trillion yuan (490 billion U.S. dollars) of revenue (excluding export rebates). It represents an increase of 11.8 percent from a year ago, compared with an annual rise of 4.8 percent registered in 2016, according to the State Administration of Taxation.
The growth is buoyed by positive economic indicators, notably the producer price index, a main gauge of inflation at the factory gate which shows the economy firming up, Zheng Xiaoying, a senior official of the administration said at a press conference.
In breakdown, the central government collected 1.54 trillion yuan and the local governments collected 1.79 trillion yuan, an increase of 11.1 percent and 12.4 percent respectively.
The service sector contributed 55.7 percent of the total, 11.6 percentage points higher than secondary industries, reflecting improvement of industrial structure, Zheng said.
Nonetheless, tax revenue from secondary industry gained steam, showing the real economy is improving, Zheng added.

GUANGZHOU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open more than 40 new stores and a cold-chain logistics distribution center in south China's Guangdong Province in the next five years, according to a strategic cooperation memorandum.
The memorandum was signed by the company and the provincial government on Thursday at the 2017 China (Guangdong)- U.S. Investment Cooperation Conference.
"In 2016, we achieved the best results in China over the past 5 years. We'll continue to grow in China and accelerate our development here in 2017," said Scott Price, Executive Vice President of Wal-Mart Global and Chief Administrative Officer of Wal-Mart International.
"Guangdong Province is where our China Home Office is and it's an important market for us. We are very optimistic about Guangdong's economic prospects and its potential, and we will continue to open stores and create more jobs here," said Price.
After entering the Chinese market in 1996, Wal-Mart now operates more than 400 stores across the country. Guangdong Province is home to 92 Wal-Mart stores. Wal-Mart plans to open eight new stores in Guangdong this year.
In addition to the new stores, Wal-Mart will improve its logistics system and build a cold-chain logistics distribution center with advanced technology in Guangdong, according to Price.

China Focus: China's capital outflows ease on firmer economy, yuan

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Pressure from capital flight has eased off markedly as firmer economic growth renewed foreign investment and the yuan steered clear of depreciation.
Net forex sales by Chinese banks rose slightly in March, official data showed Thursday.
Banks bought 145 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign currencies and sold 156.6 billion dollars, resulting in net sales of 11.6 billion dollars last month, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). The deficit was up from February's 10.1 billion dollars but lower than the 19.2 billion dollars in January.
"Generally speaking, the pressure of cross-border capital outflow eased significantly in the first quarter. Supply and demand of foreign currencies have become more balanced," said SAFE spokesperson Wang Chunying at a press conference.
In Q1 banks' net forex sales stood at 40.9 billion U.S. dollars, down 67 percent from a year ago.
There has been concern about capital flight since the second half of 2016, when the economy was facing downward pressure and the yuan was on a losing streak against the U.S. dollar. The yuan has since gradually recovered.
The central parity rate of the yuan weakened 128 basis points to 6.8792 against the U.S. dollar Thursday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. Forex reserves also rose in March for the second month to 3.0091 trillion U.S. dollars, the first back-to-back increase since April 2016. In January, reserves slipped below the 3-trillion-dollar mark.
Lian Ping, chief economist at the Bank of Communications, predicts China's cross-border capital flows will maintain stability as the impact of U.S. rate cuts has lightened. It may even be possible to see net inflows or appreciation of the yuan.
The International Monetary Fund said in a report that the capital outflow pressure could be exacerbated by tightening of global financial conditions or a shift toward protectionism in advanced economies.
Wang admitted uncertainties from U.S. rate hikes and economic conditions but said the market is accustomed to the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy changes.
"China's forex reserves only edged down 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter when the U.S. raised its interest rates for the third time since exiting quantitative easing," Wang said, in contrast with 183.8 billion dollars and 155.9 billion dollars in the first and second times.
Solid fundamentals and appeal to overseas investors will help capital flows move toward equilibrium, Wang said.
China ranked third in attracting foreign direct investment in 2016, after the United States and Britain, data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development showed.
CAPITAL CONTROL RULED OUT
The SAFE spokesperson dismissed concerns about capital controls, saying "the open window will never be closed."
"China's forex management will not turn back," Wang said, adding that despite outflows, there were no new restrictions, only strengthened scrutiny on authentication.
Current account convertibility began about two decades ago, and gradual but steady liberalization of the yuan capital account has continued since then.
In February, the forex derivatives market was opened to some overseas non-central bank institutional investors to trade forwards, forex swaps and options.

Economic Watch: China remains powerful engine for global growth

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's better-than-expected 6.9-percent economic growth in the first quarter has once again proved that the world's second-largest economy remains an important engine driving global growth.
The reading, the fastest increase in 18 months, was above the full-year target of 6.5 percent and the 6.8-percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Based on the forecast-beating data, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday upgraded its forecast for China's economic growth in 2017 and 2018 to 6.6 and 6.2 percent, respectively, 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point higher than its forecast in January.
With the strong outlook for the Chinese economy, the global growth forecast for 2017 was also raised by the IMF to 3.5 percent, up 0.1 percentage points from its January projection.
"This improvement comes primarily from good economic news for Europe and Asia, and within Asia, notably for China and Japan," IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) echoed the opinion in its 2017 Economic Survey of China, noting that the "Chinese economy will remain the major driver of global growth for the foreseeable future," as the country's GDP per capita remains on course to almost double between 2010 and 2020.
POWERHOUSE FOR WORLD GROWTH
In the wake of the international financial crisis, China's growth has bid farewell to the supercharged rates first recorded in the early 1990s and slowed to medium-high growth, which the country frequently refers to as the "new normal."
Against the backdrop of a sluggish world economy, China's GDP expanded 6.7 percent year on year in 2016, contributing more than a third of global economic growth, larger than the contribution from any other country, data from the World Bank showed.
China's economy will remain a powerful engine for world economic growth in 2017, as the fundamentals for China's long-term growth have not changed and the economic structure is optimizing by increasing the role of the consumption and service sectors, said Cai Zhizhou, a macroeconomics researcher at Peking University.
A total of 77.2 percent of the first-quarter GDP was driven by consumption, 12.6 percentage points higher than the 2016 level, official data showed.
In the first quarter, the service sector accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy, 17.8 percentage points higher than that of the secondary industry.
Stronger consumption power means huge market potential for goods and service trade across the globe, and more cooperation opportunities for the world, said Gao Yuwei, an analyst with the Bank of China's research department.
Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) showed that China maintained its position as the World's largest goods exporter in 2016. This is the eighth consecutive year China has kept its position as the world's largest goods exporter and the second-largest importer.
Meanwhile, China is also committed to opening up wider, and a more open and advanced Chinese economy would bring investment and jobs overseas, and spread optimism among global investors, said Gao.
China attracted 126 billion U.S. dollars of foreign direct investment in 2016, the largest recipient among developing countries, official data showed.
MORE ROOM FOR REFORM
Growth in the first quarter has provided opportunities for the government to advance structural reform, contain credit expansion and improve efficiency.
China should continue to prioritize reducing excess capacity, curbing the credit surge, lowering debt leverage in the corporate sector and reforming state-owned enterprises, according to the World Bank's latest report on the East Asia and Pacific Region.
The report suggests the Chinese government continue with long-term structural reforms, support new growth engines of the economy, and facilitate the economy's transition toward services and high value-added products.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also stressed in its report the importance for China to accelerate structural reforms to boost productivity and sustain growth momentum.
Strong consumer spending, fiscal support for infrastructure, and structural reforms to improve productivity in industry will keep China's economy on solid ground, said the ADB report.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks closed slightly higher on Thursday, snapping a four-day losing streak amid thin trading.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.04 percent to 3,172.1 points, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.1 percent higher at 10,359.09 points.
Total turnover on the two bourses stood at 464.9 billion yuan (67.53 billion U.S. dollars), down from 493.57 billion yuan on the previous trading day.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, ended 0.27 percent higher at 1,850.39 points.
Analysts attributed the rebound to waning investor anxiety over strengthened financial regulation, which signals the end of the market correction in past trading days.
Liquor makers and medical shares led Thursday's rally, with Yunnan Baiyao, one of the country's major pharmaceutical producers, jumping 5.44 percent to 91.31 yuan.
Kweichow Moutai rose 2.36 percent to a record high of 415.31 yuan, while Wuliangye Yibin, another famous Chinese liquor brand, gained 3.75 percent to 45.36 yuan.
Shares related to the Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, including construction firms and companies in the vicinity, continued to fall after huge gains, dragging down Thursday's rise.
On April 1, China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, which authorities described as a "major historic and strategic choice" that would be "crucial for the millennium to come," sparking investors' enthusiasm over related stocks.
BBMG Corp., a Beijing-based conglomerate in property development, construction and furniture, fell by the 10-percent daily limit to 7.43 yuan. Shares of the company rose by the maximum daily limit for 7 trading days after the announcement of the new area, nearly doubling the share price.
Tangshan Jidong Cement, a major cement producer in Hebei, also declined 5.99 percent to 20.26 yuan.

Economic Watch: China's central SOEs continue efforts to cut overcapacity

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's central government-administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have pledged to continue to cut production overcapacity in some industrial sectors, aiming to reduce steel capacity by 5.95 million tonnes and coal by 24.73 million tonnes.
"Detailed plans have been made by central SOEs," said an insider who prefers to remain anonymous.
For example, China Huaneng Group, a power company, is considering cutting 9.14 million tonnes of coal production capacity by the end of 2018 while dealing with 16 of the group's "zombie companies."
China Poly Group Corporation, a state-run conglomerate, has vowed to close inefficient coal mines and reorganize 39 of its subordinate companies to improve profits.
The latest efforts by the central SOEs will reinforce their achievements made in 2016 in reducing overcapacity.
Last year, the central SOEs eliminated steel production capacity by more than 10.19 million tonnes and coal capacity by over 34.97 million tonnes, both beating annual targets.
The capacity cut drive by central SOEs is only a part of China's bigger picture in slashing overcapacity.
The country aims to curtail steel production capacity by around 50 million tonnes and coal by at least 150 million tonnes this year, a key part of the country's supply-side reform.
To improve its growth quality and efficiency, China began its supply-side structural reform in 2015 to cut overcapacity, reduce inventory, deleverage, lower costs and strengthen weak links.
"China's SOE reform is an important link in pushing forward supply-side structural reform," said Li Jin, chief researcher with the China Enterprise Research Institute.
Realizing the significance of SOEs to the country's sustainable growth, China launched a series of reforms including cutting capacity, managing "zombie companies," cutting excessive layers of hierarchy and calling for innovation among these firms.
Overcapacity, poor corporate governance, and low labor productivity had dragged down profits of China's SOEs, which deteriorated in 2015.
In 2016, China's central SOEs cut 2,730 subsidiary legal entities and saved 4.91 billion yuan in management costs, according to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the SOE watchdog.
Thanks in part to the efforts, China's central SOEs saw profits rise slightly. Growth last year picked up from a 5.6-percent decrease in 2015.
In 2016, central SOEs made total profits of 1.23 trillion yuan (around 178 billion U.S. dollars), up 0.5 percent year on year, according to the SOE watchdog.
This year, China pledged in its annual government work report to deepen SOE reform, promising measures such as introducing a mixed-ownership system and more efforts to make SOEs leaner, healthier, and perform better.
China has 102 centrally administered SOEs, which manage the bulk of the country's state assets.
The improving figures of the SOEs contributed to the country's broader economy, which has shown more signs of stabilizing since the second half of 2016, with indicators including factory prices and industrial profits seeing significant improvements.

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China launched a national copyright monitoring website on Thursday, a step forward in the nation's crackdown on piracy.
The website, www.12426.cn, is managed by the Copyright Monitoring Center under the Copyright Society of China, providing identification, security monitoring, early warning and rights infringement solution services for registering copyright owners.
The website applies big data technology similar to fingerprint analysis, enabling it to quickly identify dubious content. It monitors various online terminals including PCs, mobile phone apps, smart TVs and live streaming platforms around the clock and has a professional team dealing with rights infringement offline.
The intellectual property rights (IPR) protection environment has remarkably changed in China, both from a legal perspective and in terms of technological application, said Yan Xiaohong, head of the Copyright Monitoring Center. He hopes the website can play a bigger role in IPR protection, especially in the protection of online IPR.
The website will not only serve the copyright owners, but will provide technological support for Chinese authorities' campaigns targeting online piracy, according to the center.

Chinese banks' net forex sales slightly up in March

BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Net foreign exchange (forex) sales by Chinese banks rose slightly in March while capital outflow still remained tame, official data showed Thursday.
Banks bought 145 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign currencies and sold 156.6 billion dollars, resulting in net sales of 11.6 billion dollars last month, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
The deficit was up from February's 10.1 billion dollars but lower than the 19.2 billion dollars in January.
"Generally speaking, the pressure of cross-border capital outflow has eased significantly in the first quarter, and the demand and supply of foreign currencies have become more balanced," said SAFE spokesperson Wang Chunying during a press conference.
In the January-March period, banks' net forex sales stood at 40.9 billion U.S. dollars, down 67 percent from a year ago.
There had been rising concerns about capital flight since the second half of 2016, when the economy was facing looming downward pressure and the Chinese yuan was in the middle of a losing streak against the U.S. dollar.
But the yuan has gradually recovered from its weakness as the Chinese economy firmed up in the first quarter of the year, with forecast-beating GDP growth, and the greenback became less volatile.
The central parity rate of the yuan weakened 128 basis points to 6.8792 against the U.S. dollar Thursday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
Another indicator of cross-border capital flow, China's forex reserves rose for the second month in a row in March to 3.0091 trillion U.S. dollars, the first back-to-back increase since April 2016. In January, the reserves slipped below the closely watched 3-trillion-dollar mark.
Cross-border capital flows will continue to head for equilibrium due to China's solid economic fundamentals and strong appeal to overseas investors, Wang said.
With enormous market potential, China ranked third in the world in attracting foreign direct investment in 2016, only after the United States and Britain, and topped the list of emerging economies, data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development showed.
The government has rolled out an array of measures to open up more to the world, granting easier access for foreign investors and improving the business environment.
Wang also cited continued opening up in the financial sector, a more flexible yuan, a current account surplus and abundant forex reserves.

Spotlight: Resilient growth of China injects vigor into world economy

Editor: An
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2017, while China's robust economic growth is one of the main factors that supported the improved outlook.
Amid a rising tide of protectionism and increasing policy uncertainties, China's economy remains resilient, which has contributed a lot to global growth.
STRONGER GLOBAL GROWTH
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast the global economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 2017, an acceleration from the 3.1 percent growth last year and an upgrade of 0.1 percentage point from its January projection. It kept the 2018 forecast for global economic growth unchanged at 3.6 percent.
"Our new projection for 2017 is marginally higher than what we expected in our last update. This improvement comes primarily from good economic news for Europe and Asia, and within Asia, notably for China and Japan," IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld told a press conference on Tuesday.
Momentum in the global economy has been building since the middle of 2016, Obstfeld said, noting that the acceleration of global economic growth will be broad-based across advanced, emerging and low-income economies, building on gains in both manufacturing and trade.
Commodity prices have recovered since bottoming out a year ago, relieving global deflationary pressure, according to the IMF report.
It also described financial markets as "buoyant" amid expectations of further stimulus in China, along with fiscal expansion in the United States.
"The global economy seems to be gaining momentum -- we could be at a turning point," Obstfeld said.
A RESILIENT CHINA
In its report, the IMF upgraded its estimate for China's growth to 6.6 percent from its previous projection of 6.5 percent for the year of 2017, and to 6.2 percent from the previous 6.0 percent for next year.
The upward revision reflects the stronger-than-expected momentum of the Chinese economy in 2016 and the anticipation of continued policy support, said the IMF.
Obstfeld said China's desirable rebalancing process continues, as seen in a declining current account surplus and an increased share of services in its gross domestic product (GDP).
"Obviously, the leadership has made impressive reforms," said Obstfeld. "With those reforms, we are confident in China maintaining stability down the road."
The IMF is not the only international institution which is confident about China's economic growth.
The World Bank said in a report earlier this year that China's economy will continue sustainable growth as it is rebalancing from manufacturing to services.
In its flagship Global Economic Prospects report, the Washington-based lender expected the Chinese economy to grow 6.5 percent in 2017 and 6.3 percent in 2018, unchanged from the forecast it made in June 2016.
Macroeconomic policies are expected to support China's key domestic drivers of growth despite softness of external demand and overcapacity in some sectors, said the bank.
It expected that China's efforts to rebalance its economy from industry to services, and from investment to consumption will continue moderate progress.
According to the World Bank, China could secure a sustainable growth in the medium term while avoid a sharp slowdown, if the country continues to push forward additional fiscal reforms, further state-owned enterprises reforms and land and labor market reforms.
In a report published last week, the World Bank said China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth has continued, and it expected the Chinese economy to slow gradually as it rebalanced toward consumption and services.
"Chinese policymakers will manage the balancing act," which means that they will continue with long-term structural reforms, support new growth engines and facilitate the economy transition towards services and high value-added products, said Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region.
MID-TERM RISKS
While raising its forecast for global economic growth, the IMF also warned of the downside risks facing the global economy.
"Risks remain skewed to the downside, however, especially over the medium term, with pervasive uncertainty surrounding policies," said the report.
It warned that inward-looking policies threaten global integration and the cooperative global economic order, a faster-than-expected pace of interest rate hikes in the United States could tighten global financial conditions, and an aggressive rollback of financial regulation could spur excessive risk taking and increase the likelihood of future financial crisis.
"The world economy may be gaining momentum, but we cannot be sure that we are out of the woods," said Obstfeld.

The weakening of the yuan came after it strengthened 185 basis points to 6.8664 against the dollar Wednesday on the back of a string of upbeat economic data including the gross domestic product (GDP), which rose 6.9 percent year on year in the first quarter.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, rebounded Wednesday after Tuesday declining to the lowest level in three weeks.
In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.
The central parity rate of the yuan against the dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day.

SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Car models supporting autonomous driving and Internet-based services are bright spots at the 2017 Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition, which opened to media Wednesday.
A total of 113 models of car made their global debut at the auto show, which has attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors from 18 countries and regions. The 1,400 complete vehicles exhibited include 159 new energy vehicles and 56 concept cars.
The theme of this year's auto show is "Committed to Better Life," and the event will be open to the public from April 21 to 28.
The Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup Nio made its much-awaited domestic debut at the show, bringing a model of its concept driverless car EVE, whose interior space is designed as a living room.
Li Bin, founder of Nio, said that when humans are freed from driving in the future, the car would be transformed into a space for relaxation and entertainment.
Domestic auto maker Roewe unveiled its new model i6 16T, featuring a smart operation system that has access to mobile payment tool Alipay.
When the driver gets on the car, the system tells them to bring an umbrella if it is going to rain. It can select routes based on real-time road conditions and the driver's habits, and can even help order and pay for a take-away coffee.
Sales of the RX5, another Roewe model that carries a similar system, have exceeded 140,000 since it was released eight months ago.
German manufacturer BMW also brought new models featuring intelligent driving to the show.
"The concept of 'Auto plus Internet' is not only about surfing the Internet in the car," said Chen Zhixin, president of Shanghai-based SAIC Motor. "A car should be seen as a smart end-product embedded with various functions supported by cloud services."
New energy vehicles (NEV) are also making waves at the show, including Nio's two-door EP9, a contender for the title of the world's fastest electric car. A total of 159 NEVs are on display at the event.
In 2016, more than 500,000 NEVs were sold in China, accounting for over40 percent of global sales. The growth was up 50 percent year on year.
China has had the world's largest car market for eight consecutive years. About 28 million cars were sold in China in 2016, up 13.7 percent year on year thanks to preferential purchase policies and other government measures, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
Growth in auto sales in 2017 were estimated to slow to an annual 2 to 6 percent, according to the ministry.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of patent applications in Beijing hit nearly 190,000 in 2016, up 21 percent year on year, according to local authorities.
Among the applications, more than 100,000 were for invention patents, which increased around 17 percent from a year earlier, said Pan Xinsheng, spokesperson of the Beijing intellectual property bureau Wednesday.
Last year, more than 40,000 invention patents were authorized, up 15 percent year on year, among a total of over 100,500 recognized patents.
The Beijing Intellectual Property Court handled over 10,600 intellectual property rights (IPR) cases in 2016.
Specialized IPR courts were established in 2014 in Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, leading to a significant improvement in IPR regulation.

Across China: Apples sweeten trade along ancient silk road

XI'AN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The mythic hero Hou Ji is said to have taught Chinese people to grow grain in the Yangling region some 4,000 years ago. Today, the agricultural zone has attracted teams from across the world to learn apple-growing techniques.
White-blossomed apple trees adorn the 35 hectares of this orchard in Yangling District, a high-tech agricultural zone in Xianyang City of Shaanxi Province. Unlike apple trees elsewhere, they appear shorter.
"We are using a new technique to keep the trees shorter and planted more densely to facilitate management and improve effectiveness," said Zhang Xiaocai, who is in charge of technology at the Huicheng fruit company.
Thousands of kilometers away in Kazakhstan, the same technique is used on 10 hectares of an orchard.
"We provide technical support, teaching them how to make organic fertilizer and how to trim the branches," Zhang said.
Kazakhstan began sending teams to learn the technique in 2013, after finding that the yield of apples per hectare in Yangling is 7,500 to 15,000 kilograms higher. An orchard using Chinese technology was built in Kazakhstan the next year.
"We now receive phone calls from Kazakhstan from time to time, asking for instructions," said Zhang. She added that the orchard was only the first step of their cooperation with Kazakhstan, which plans to import seedlings from China.
Kazakhstan is not the only country to cooperate with Yangling. In the orchard, students of a 25-day workshop are learning about water-saving irrigation. They come from colleges, institutes and governments in Mongolia, Nepal, Tanzania, South Sudan and Sri Lanka.
"While sharing our technology, we learn from others as well," said Guo Lanjun, general manager of Huicheng. They imported quality seedlings from foreign countries, like the green apple from Australia, which is popular among customers with high blood sugar.
With its age-oldspider agricultural civilization, Yangling has trained some 1,500 people from more than 100 countries in agricultural knowledge and techniques in recent years.
The Shaanxi provincial government has done its utmost to promote modern agriculture exchanges and cooperation with relevant countries and regions under the Belt and Road Initiative, a grand trade and infrastructure plan proposed by China in 2013.
Building upon ancient trade routes, the modern Belt and Road will be a transnational network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa and promoting common development among all countries involved.
Over the past three decades, Shaanxi Province has earned a sterling reputation worldwide because of its apples. One in every seven apples in the world is grown in Shaanxi.
According to Xi'an Customs, enterprises in Shaanxi exported 200,000 tonnes of apples in 2016 with a total value of more than one billion yuan (around 150 million U.S. dollars). Countries along the Belt and Road are major consumers of Shaanxi apples.
Thailand, Myanmar, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia are the top five among 24 countries and regions that imported Shaanxi apples last year, according to Fan Hailong, deputy head of the Shaanxi fruit industry management bureau.
"We feel proud after seeing more and more Shaanxi apples on the supermarket shelves in India," said Han Jilong, vice general manager of Shenglong Fruit Industry Company in Baishui County, which is called "China's apple town."
Founded in 2008, the company became the biggest exporter among fruit companies in the province last year, with apple exports worth more than 19 million U.S. dollars.
"If silk and porcelain were the signatures of ancient China, the apple may serve as a symbol for modern China, especially western China," said He Cheng, the Xi'an office chief of the Kazakhstan International Integration Fund.

ZHENGZHOU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's second commodity options, white sugar options, started trading on Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange Wednesday.
"Businesses can now use a combination of investment tools including spot contracts, futures contracts, and options to manage risks more effectively," said Ma Wensheng, chairman of Xinhu Futures, a Shanghai-based futures brokerage firm.
Unlike futures contract, options give investors the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying assets at a predetermined price, effectively giving investors some insurance against future price volatility.
The white sugar options are China's second commodity options after soybean meal, currently trading on Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Fang Xinghai, deputy head of China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the financial instrument will facilitate the sustainable and healthy of the sugar industry, benefitting 40 million sugar cane farmers in China's remote and poor regions.
As demand for commodity derivatives rises, more futures and options products will be launched, according to Fang.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government plans new tax cuts to reduce the burden on businesses, support innovation and stabilize growth.
Tax cuts were approved Wednesday at a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang, after the government announced measures to reduce business costs in the first quarter.
Value-added tax will be simplified, more small and micro companies will enjoy income tax incentives, and pre-tax deductions for innovation-based tech companies will rise, according to a statement made public after the meeting.
Tax incentives for venture capital firms will expand, with pre-tax deduction of commercial health insurance nationwide and a package of tax-cuts due to expire by 2016 extended for another three years.
A government work report released in March promised around 350 billion yuan (51 billion U.S. dollars) of cuts to corporate taxes and with business fees cut by around 200 billion yuan in 2017.
After the new measures become effective, the total tax reduction will amount to more than 380 billion yuan this year, the statement said.
The meeting ordered authorities to implement the policies as soon as possible and come up with more new measures to reduce business fees.
The meeting also approved a draft law on public libraries, which will be forwarded to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will move to increase job creation and encourage entrepreneurship as employment pressure rises, according to a government document released on Wednesday.
The document, approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, underlined the importance of job creation, urging policy makers to work out more pro-job policies.
Support should be extended to micro and emerging businesses, the engines of job creation. A more flexible social security system should be applied to those sectors to protect rights of the employees.
The document also urged local authorities to cut red tape to encourage entrepreneurship and extend more subsidies to the start-ups set up by college graduates and overseas returnees.
The government should reach out to zero-employment and low-income families and ensure at least one family member has a job.
China's job market faces grim reality as the economy slows while college graduates increase every year.

MACAO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- One of Macao's major bank has granted over 3 billion patacas (about 375 million U.S. dollars) since 2016 to support enterprises in doing business in countries and regions along the "Belt and Road", local media reported Wednesday.

The report said the bank has granted loans to companies from Macao, the Chinese mainland and overseas to develop programs in Vietnam, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Israel, Indonesia, Myanmar, the United Arab Emirates, etc.
The newspaper also mentioned that those programs include traditional trade finance, port construction, energy development, and production capacity cooperation. Due to the advantages of Macao financial system and regulation, such as low taxation, no foreign exchange control, good cross-border financial service, BOCMacao accomplished those programs and helped those companies in their business cooperation.
BOCMacao has also created business links with regional organizations.


Economic Watch: China's economy growing beyond growth

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- While some say that China still relies on its traditional growth boosters for its strong results, the world' s second largest economy is making strides far beyond its expectation-beating growth.
Taking a closer look at China's 6.9-percent economic expansion in the first quarter, it is the increasing role of the consumption and service sectors, rather than infrastructure spending and credit growth, that deserves attention.
First-quarter GDP growth accelerated from 6.8 percent in the previous quarter, and 77.2 percent of it was driven by consumption, 12.6 percentage points higher than the 2016 level, according to official data.
Meanwhile, the service sector rose 7.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, outpacing a 3-percent increase in agriculture and 6.4 percent in the secondary industry. It accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy.
The Chinese economy has not only been able to avoid a "hard landing," but is stabilizing and improving with better structure and more jobs, according to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang Tuesday.
Mao Shengyong, a spokesperson with the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS), said the Chinese were spending more on services, and the domestic wave of innovations and entrepreneurship had brought in new businesses and new methods of consumption.
Innovation and start-ups are also a steady source of new jobs and income increase, with 3.34 million new jobs created in the first quarter and the surveyed unemployment rate staying under 5 percent.
The per capita real disposable income of Chinese nationwide increased 7 percent year on year in real terms, outpacing the GDP growth rate in the period, while that of rural residents rose at a faster pace of 7.2 percent.
The pickup in China's economic growth was not a result of short-term monetary stimulus, but rather increasing demand triggered by urbanization and supply-side structural reform, said Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Center under the State Council.
Xu Hongcai, economist with the State Information Center, said the highlight of the first-quarter data was a pickup in private investment, which climbed 7.7 percent year-on-year, a significant increase from the 3.2 percent growth in 2016.
The reforms and other measures taken by the government to encourage private investment since the second half of 2016 have paid off, he said.
China has shifted away from pursuing breakneck expansion to facilitate further reforms as the government trimmed this year's growth goal to around 6.5 percent from a range of 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016.
At the same time, the country has set ambitious targets regarding structural adjustment such as creating 11 million new jobs and slashing steel production capacity by around 50 million tonnes and coal by at least 150 million tonnes.
China must speed up replacing oldspider growth drivers with new ones to transform and upgrade the economy, said Premier Li, citing a challenging world economic recovery and relatively heavy downward pressure in the domestic economy.
The World Bank said in a report last week that China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth had continued, and it expected the Chinese economy to slow gradually as it rebalanced toward consumption and services.
"Chinese policymakers will manage the balancing act," which means that they will continue with long-term structural reforms, support new growth engines and facilitate the economy transitioning towards services and high value-added products, said Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region.
Mao said it was "no big deal" if economic growth slipped by a few tenths of a percentage points in the near future, noting that China's economic growth rate had become less volatile in recent years, with 6.9 percent for 2015, 6.7 percent for 2016 and 6.9 percent for the first quarter of 2017.
Other than spurring growth, the priority for China's economic policies must now be given to furthering supply-side structural reform to lay a solid foundation for medium and long-term development, said Zhang Liqun.

Economic Watch: China's Internet finance thrives as fraud fades

2017-04-19 19:24:25
Editor: An
by Xinhua Writer Jiang Xufeng
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Wang Pengfei, vice president of a leading Internet finance company, has seen the industry grow in China at a galloping pace, along with some shady practices.
After working at a state-owned lender for a decade, Wang joined Weidai, an Internet finance company whose name means "micro-loan," in 2014 when the industry was flourishing.
FAST BUT FRAUDULENT
The industry's burgeoning development came as no accident to Wang and other market observers.
China has four large state-owned banks, and state-owned enterprises generally have easier access to financing. Many small companies are troubled by the financing bottleneck, creating pent-up demand.
Meanwhile, working-class families struggle to figure out where to invest their savings to seek higher returns, and many of them move money online. The country, home to the world's biggest online population, also has a number of groups, such as college students, who are underserved by banks.
China has not established a sound social credit system, and credit cards are not as popular as in some advanced economies. Online payment has instead emerged as a well-received alternative to cash. Crowd funding has picked up momentum as a wave of entrepreneurship has hit the country.
Development of Internet finance has helped broaden the financial reach, improve efficiency of financial services, give Chinese more investment options, and help some small businesses get badly needed loans, but the boom has its costs.
The first peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform was launched in 2007, and exploded in popularity in China, with the number of such platforms surging 18 times between 2012 and 2015 and the combined transaction volume jumping about 40 times over the period, according to data from the State Information Center.
P2P lending platforms helped link clients seeking better yields with borrowers starved for capital, but a report from leading industry information provider www.wdzj.com painted a grim picture. By March 2017, 3,607 Chinese P2P lending platforms had run into trouble or been forced to close, with only 2,281 platforms in normal operation.
With a relatively low barrier to entry in the industry, some high-profile fraud cases emerged and grabbed headlines, such as P2P lending platform Ezubao that cheated investors out of nearly 60 billion yuan (8.7 billion U.S. dollars) through fake investment projects.
Some bogus lending platforms diverted client funds for other purposes, while online Chinese loan sharks illegally demanded nude photos as a form of collateral from cash-strapped female college students. These cases have triggered the concerns of regulators and a year-long industry correction.
On top of P2P lending, Internet finance also covers business such as third-party online payment, crowd funding, and other financial services.
"In tandem with the rapid growth, China's Internet finance industry is afflicted with Ponzi schemes and some companies deviate from their main business to seek hefty profits," said Li Bo, a researcher with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank.
When introduced to a long list of wealth management products they have never heard of, many individual investors, such as retirees, have ended up as victims of unscrupulous online finance platforms, sometimes losing their life savings.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang earlier this month cautioned that the country's financial sector was vulnerable to risks such as bad assets, bond defaults, shadow banking and Internet finance, with frequent illegal and corrupt activities.
Risk caused by the Internet finance industry has wide repercussions. Some P2P lending platforms resembled hybrid financial institutions providing clients with various financial services online, analysts said.
"Some online finance entities have performed illegal services, which creates contagion risk for banks, as financial agencies are intertwined with one another," said Ou Minggang, director of the International Finance Research Center at China Foreign Affairs University.
SUPERVISION TO CATCH UP
"Before 2017, the industry was full of fraud, such as problematic P2P lending platforms and fraudulent borrowers using false information. With strengthened and coordinated supervision among different regulators, the industry will embrace reasonable development," Wang said.
Wang found that some important industry regulations such as those on crowd funding took effect in 2014, and targeted regulations have been rolled out by national and local authorities since 2016 for some murky and less-regulated areas.
Regulations on Internet finance services such as third-party payment are relatively sound, but regulations in other areas need to be improved, said PBOC deputy governor Pan Gongsheng.
"The pace of business innovation has outpaced supervision in recent years, with companies producing new financial products to bypass supervision and hurt investors' interests," Ou stressed.
"Regulators face a steep learning curve, and they must keep abreast of the ever-changing industry landscape. They should focus on Internet finance companies' business and what their financial products really mean for investors," Ou added.
Businesses such as P2P lending, Internet-based insurance, third-party online payment, and online asset management were among key areas for strengthened supervision, industry observers said.
Internet finance last week appeared on the top banking regulator's list of ten most important areas for enhanced risk control, with targeted measures to be taken to stem emergence of a financial crisis.
For P2P lending alone, regulators have unveiled specific policies including 13 restrictions to prohibit P2P platforms from accepting public deposits, pooling investors' money for their own projects, providing guarantees for lenders, or selling financial products.
Wang also suggested learning from the experience of advanced economies and strengthening efforts to establish a social credit system with participation by both regulators and credit scoring companies.
Better consumer protection laws and regulations should be in place, and supervision of products from Internet finance companies must be strengthened, with better conflict resolution schemes to be established, Li suggested.
Wang said 2017 will be a watershed year for Chinese Internet finance as the rules are tightened, bringing the industry out of the wilderness.

Beijing punishes livestreaming sites, Apple App Store to be summoned

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Internet regulators said Apple is next on a list for inquiries after authorities ordered three Chinese live streaming websites to rectify management loopholes.
The three websites are toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com, which were found to have violated four different regulations concerning Internet information services, live-streaming services and online performance, according to the Beijing Cyberspace Administration.
In a joint inquiry, conducted by the administration, the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team, the three companies were found to lack systematic management and to have been inadequate in checking information, emergency response and technical support.
"Significant loopholes" also existed in their management of live-broadcast products, user classification, authentication of user identity and the handling of tips-offs, according to the regulators.
Some publishers have broadcast live content forbidden by Chinese law on these platforms, they noted.
Some provided pornographic content, according to the regulators.
Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team said it has collected and sorted evidence on the violations at huoshanzhibo.com and huajiao.com and started investigation.
Some cases will be transferred to the police, and publishers that have committed violations shall receive criminal punishment.
Officers with the law enforcement team said they have also met representatives from Apple about the examination of live stream apps from the tech giant's app store.
The Beijing Cyberspace Administration confirmed that the three departments will jointly summon Apple over the issues to urge the American firm to tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares fell for a fourth straight day on Wednesday as investors have turned more cautious on tightened regulation.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.81 percent to close at 3,170.69 points.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.61 percent to 10,348.41 points. The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, edged down 0.15 percent to 1,845.38 points.
Total turnover on the two bourses rose slightly to 493.57 billion yuan (71.88 billion U.S. dollars), slightly up from the previous trading day.
Analysts attributed the bearish performance partly to strengthened financial regulation.
The banking regulator announced an array of measures to rein in high-risk business of banks and crack down on shadow banking, while the securities watchdog acted hard against speculation and manipulation.
The official moves will to some extent drain liquidity and push up interest rates, which means less capital inflow for the stock market, said Wang Delun, an analyst with Industrial Securities.
The shipbuilding, cement and coal sectors led the declines, while some heavyweights also tumbled.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's largest bank by assets, dropped 1.04 percent to 4.74 yuan per share, while China's largest oil refinery PetroChina Company slipped 2.01 percent to 7.8 yuan per share.
Bucking the trend, companies related to environmental protection saw marked increases.
China's GDP posted forecast-beating growth of 6.9 percent in the first quarter, which, analysts said, allows financial regulators to channel more energy into de-leveraging, squeezing asset bubbles and defusing risks.

MANAUS, Brazil, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Perennial hot weather has made Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, a hot pie in the eyes of global manufacturers of air conditioners.
Gree, China's largest air conditioner producer, has pulled ahead of its competitors in the Brazilian market, with energy-efficient technology, updated products and omnipresent service.
"As one of the earliest Chinese home appliance producers going overseas, we have been in Brazil for 16 years, have a presence in 24 states in the country, and have over 300 dealers and more than 500 service providers," Xie Dongbo, general manager of Gree Brazil, told Xinhua.
LESS ENERGY, MORE BREEZE
One in every three air conditioners in service in the world is made by Gree.
Gree has topped the world for 12 years in terms of production and sales volumes of air conditioners, and has remained China's leading household electric appliances manufacturer for 14 years, with its revenues edging up to 15 billion U.S. dollars in 2015, according to its official website.
Split systems with inverter design helps contribute to the giant producer's global leadership, particularly in Brazil, though the country's economy has stayed sluggish for the past several years.
"In Brazil, we are famous for energy and environment conservation. In this regard, we have been praised annually by the highest levels of the Brazilian government since 2004," said Xie.
TOP SALES, ZERO COMPLAINT
The year 2016 was an exceptional one for Gree. The company was authorized to provide its products for the stadiums, the athletes' village and media centers of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
"According to the organizing committee, there was zero complaints about our service and products during the Rio Olympics, which meant that none of our machines broke down when the Games were held. We won the respect of the organizing committee," Wang Weizhen, deputy general manager of Gree Brazil, told Xinhua.
Prior to the Games, Gree Brazil passed a review for its production management, social responsibility and sustainable development.
"This was a full dimensional examination of Gree," Wang added.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) giant Baidu decided Wednesday to share an open, complete and reliable software platform with its partners in the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help upgrade the sector.
Through the Apollo project, Baidu will build a collaborative ecosystem using its strength in AI technology to work with other companies to promote the development and popularization of autonomous driving technology.
The Apollo project provides platforms for vehicles, hardware, software and cloud data services and Baidu will share resources and capabilities in obstacle perception, trajectory planning, vehicle control, operating systems and other functions, as well as a complete set of testing tools.
Baidu will first introduce its autonomous driving technology in restricted environments in July, then expand to cars running autonomously on simple urban road conditions toward the end of the year. It will gradually introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020.
The company will work with partners with the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components and offer references and recommendations to participants.
"AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles," said Lu Qi, Group President and Chief Operating Officer at Baidu.
Baidu has been investing in R&D for autonomous driving technology since 2015. It conducted successful road tests for its fully autonomous cars on the highways and roads of Beijing in late 2015 and finished open trial operations of its autonomous car fleet in late 2016 at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, where over 200 guest passengers rode in the cars.
Baidu is the first among the major global autonomous driving players to open its technology and platform to the industry.
"An open, innovative industry ecosystem will accelerate the development of autonomous driving in the United States and other developed automotive markets, and through open technology our technological achievements can be quickly applied to a wide range of fields and accelerate even more achievements," Lu added.

IMF upgrades China's growth forecast in 2017 and 2018

WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday upgraded its forecast for China's economic growth in 2017 and 2018, reflecting the stronger-than-expected momentum of the Chinese economy in 2016.
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF expects the Chinese economy to grow 6.6 percent in 2017 and 6.2 percent in 2018, 0.1 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point higher than its forecast in January.
The upward revision reflects the stronger-than-expected momentum of the Chinese economy in 2016 and the anticipation of continued policy support, said the IMF.
With the strong outlook for the Chinese economy, the global growth forecast for 2017 was also raised. The IMF expects the global economy to grow 3.5 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its January projection.
"This improvement comes primarily from good economic news for Europe and Asia, and within Asia, notably for China and Japan," IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said.
China's rebalancing process continues, as seen in a declining current account surplus and an increasing share of services in its gross domestic product (GDP), said Obstfeld.
However, the IMF suggested China take measures to address the growing vulnerabilities associated with the rapid credit expansion.
It also warned that protectionist measures adopted by advanced economies could lead to a broader tightening of financial conditions in China, possibly exacerbated by capital outflow pressure, which could have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.

SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The C919, the first large passenger aircraft designed and built by China passed the last expert assessment on Tuesday, its manufacturer announced.
The aircraft was given the go-ahead to begin a series of high-speed taxiing tests, the last step before its maiden flight. The process usually takes one to two months.
According to Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC), 25 experts from Chinese research institutes, civil aviation administration, and domestic jet makers formed Tuesday's assessment panel. They reviewed the preparedness of both the aircraft and ground services for the maiden flight.
In March, the aircraft passed a major technical assessment.
The C919, with over 150 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is a medium-haul commercial aircraft.
The Chinese jetliner was rolled off assembly line in 2015. COMAC said 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 aircraft by the end of 2016, and it expects sales to exceed 2,000.
China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. The ARJ21, its first regional aircraft, began commercial operations in June 2016.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China has expanded a pilot program to allow more domestic banks to issue securities backed by non-performing assets, Xinhua-run Shanghai Securities News reported Tuesday.
Commercial banks including China Minsheng Bank, China Everbright Bank, and China CITIC Bank were among the institutions recently selected for the program, the newspaper reported.
China started a pilot program for non-performing asset securitization in 2016, allowing five state-owned banks and China Merchants Bank to repackage non-performing assets into securities to meet the demand of investors with different risk preferences.
By the end of 2016, 14 securitization products had been issued with a total value of 15.6 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars), covering 46.1 billion yuan of underlying non-performing assets, Ji Zhihong, head of the financial market department of China's central bank, said in a report published Tuesday.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The value of bonds issued in China totaled 3.9 trillion yuan (about 570 billion U.S. dollars) last month, up by about 1.2 trillion yuan from February, the central bank said Tuesday.
Bonds issued on the inter-bank market reached 3.6 trillion yuan, data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) showed.
The balance of outstanding bonds was 65.9 trillion yuan by the end of March, up from 64.8 trillion yuan at the end of February and 63.7 trillion yuan at the end of last year.
China supports development of direct financing to reduce costs of enterprises, allowing them to get funds by issuing shares or bonds, rather than from commercial banks.
PBOC said in February that the country will give full play to the bond market's role in raising the share of direct financing, containing financial risks and optimizing resource allocation.
In 2016, China issued 36.1 trillion yuan in various kinds of bonds, up 54.2 percent from 2015, data showed.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's tightened regulations on the property market to rein in skyrocketing home prices have begun to pay off as home prices in major cities continued to stabilize.
Of 70 large and medium-sized cities surveyed, 24 cities witnessed a slower price rise year on year in March, up from 20 in February, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday.
Among the 15 first- and second-tier cities surveyed, six cities saw a month-on-month price decline in March and six saw price gains of less than 0.5 percent.
In Beijing, new residential house prices rose 0.4 percent month on month in March, while Shanghai prices fell 0.1 percent. House prices in Shenzhen, a southern metropolis neighboring Hong Kong, slid 0.3 percent.
"Prices of newly built homes in 15 major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen continued to stabilize in March on the back of targeted local government policies," said NBS statistician Liu Jianwei.
Property sales recorded strong growth in 2016 with an annual gain of 22.5 percent, thanks to two years of policy easing, starting with relaxation of purchase restrictions in 2014 and fueled by pro-growth policies, including interest-rate cuts.
Since October last year, the Chinese government has implemented a slew of measures to cool runaway housing prices, including restrictions on home purchases and increased minimum down-payment requirements.
The property market, however, picked up its pace in February this year after price gains slowed in previous months, which has led to the biggest wave of tightening of home purchase and lending rules since mid-March.
Dozens of Chinese cities have implemented tougher cooling measures to limit price gains since mid-March, following Beijing's unprecedented harsh curbs that lifted the down-payment ratio for second homes to 60 percent.
Meanwhile, China's central bank has also urged banks to strengthen
mortgage risk management and crack down on market irregularities such as fake divorces to skirt high down-payment requirements.
Even against the backdrop of such severe housing regulations, home prices in some cities still recorded higher growth in March, showing that the country's housing regulation still has a long way to go, said Xia Dan, a senior researcher at the Bank of Communications, one of China's top five lenders.
NBS data showed that 18 of 70 cities surveyed witnessed a month-on-month price decline or a slower price uptick in March.
New residential house prices in Guangzhou, Haikou and Sanya registered month-on-month growth of more than 2 percent in March, according to the NBS data.
Xia predicted that cities with higher growth in home prices will see more housing regulations in the future and the regulating focus will gradually shift to the second-hand home market.
Speaking at a press conference on Monday, NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong admitted that the influence of China's property controls will gradually become evident in April and the following months as they were only introduced in mid-March.
He emphasized that the government will take more category-based and targeted steps to regulate the real estate market to make sure that "houses are for living in, not for speculating with."
For the years ahead, China will build a market-oriented and long-term mechanism to curtail a property bubble and prevent big market fluctuations, said Mao.
Liu Hongyu, head of the real estate research institute of Tsinghua University, agreed, noting that a long-term mechanism, featuring increased land supply and a sound housing finance system, real estate tax system and urbanization infrastructure construction, should be established to ensure stable and healthy development of the real estate market.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's non-financial outbound direct investment (ODI) dropped 48.8 percent year on year to 20.54 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, official data showed Tuesday.
In March alone, the country's non-financial ODI declined 30.1 percent year on year to 7.11 billion U.S. dollars, according to the Ministry of Commerce (MOC).
Chinese companies invested in 2,170 overseas enterprises in 129 countries and regions in the first three months, said the statement posted on the MOC website.
In the first quarter, engineering contracts totaling 42.96 billion U.S. dollars were signed by Chinese companies with overseas partners, down 7 percent from the same period last year.
However, the contract value signed in March rose 22.2 percent year on year to hit 17.92 billion U.S. dollars, the MOC statement said.
The Belt and Road Initiative has boosted business cooperation between Chinese and foreign firms, an MOC official was quoted as saying in the statement.
Outbound investment to countries involved in the initiative accounted for 14.4 percent of the total ODI in the first three months, up 5.4 percentage points from that in 2016.
Manufacturing, commercial service and information transmission as well as the software and information technology industries took the lead in investment value, showing the special attention Chinese companies show to the real economy and emerging industries in outbound investment.
In the first quarter, nearly 80 percent of the engineering contract value was contributed by 156 large projects, each of which has an investment of more than 50 million U.S. dollars, according to the MOC.
Meanwhile, China's fixed-asset investment grew 9.2 percent year on year, quickening from the 8.9-percent growth registered in the first two months, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday.

Spotlight: Chinese estate builder roots in Peru with quality, efficiency

LIMA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Through eight years of hard work, a large-scale property constructor from China has gained strong foothold in Peru, with new contracts rolling in, on the basis of its well-received finished projects.
"The apartment for us, me and my husband, is comfortable. It is spacious and very safe," said Cristina Gamarra, a local in Lima who had just moved into a 20-storey apartment completed by the Yanjian Group from eastern China's Shandong province.
The two high-rising commercial estates in the Jesus Maria District in the capital are the latest project that Yanjian has fulfilled since its entrance into the South American country in 2009.
They did a good job for the district, said Miguel Aldaba, local administrator for the project. "So far we have not found any problem with water. The structure and design perpetually keep the water out," he added, referring to the wet weather in Lima.
EXEMPLARY PROJECTS
Yanjian started exploring the Peruvian market in September 2009 with a refurbishing project of the state-owned Loayza Hospital in downtown Lima, a contract the company gained from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
Founded in 1924, Loayza has well-established reputation among patients, but its service has been compromised by the dilapidated infrastructure.
Yanjian, a construction company with a history of 65 years, came to wield its wrists on the field, transforming the hospital's dining hall into an over 4,200-square-meter modern facility providing comprehensive treatment.
It took only a little more than a year for Yanjian to finish the work.
"With 65-year-long construction experience and consideration of the local demands, we pay much attention to the details of design and building to meet as many requirements as possible," General Manager of Yanjian Peru Wang Shuwei told Xinhua.
Another landmark project completed by Yanjian is the China-Peru Friendship Hall, which was built to honor the long-standing relations between the two countries.
"A lot of work has been done. It is coordinated, because Andrew (the Spanish name of Wang Shuwei) is a person who has had a very strong collaborating team," local engineer Armando Ramos told Xinhua.
In 2015, Yanjian undertook the construction of Jose Maria Arguedas Primary School, a project that won the hearts of the parents of the school children in suburban Lima as the school helps sustain their children's education.
Cracking difficulties like shortage of water and blocking hills and slopes, Yanjian completed the building process half a year ahead of the schedule.
"The core demand and urgent nature for real estate building is perfect management. A stable structure needs to be guaranteed by harmonizing beams and columns to endure earthquakes and other occurrences," said Pedro Ortiz, one of Yanjian's local staff.
FROM TRAILBLAZER TO MARKET WINNER
For house building in Peru, quake resistance and water proof are the peculiar demands.
To meet the target, Yanjian has paid much attention to the structure design, material selection, function consideration and construction management, which result in high quality building and win deep trust from the Peruvian government and local people.
In February, the group won a bid to build a national emergency response center in Lima, which claims over 8,800-square-meter land with a command headquarters and a stimulation facility.
Local employees are happy to see their Chinese employer prosper in Peru through hard work and quality service, for they have also benefited a lot from Yanjian's growth.
"From its very beginning, I became involved (with Yanjian) in building houses ... As I have been developing my career, I grow interested in construction, a beautiful career to follow," said Ortiz.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's housing authority increased residential land supply in the first quarter to meet rising demand, official data showed on Monday.
In the first quarter, residential land supply in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou increased by over 50 percent from the same period a year ago, according to data collected by the China Urban Land Price Dynamic Monitor.
Land supply in second-tier cities also rose remarkably while supply in third-tier cities fell.
New home prices in Beijing and Shanghai rose by over 20 percent in the past year as residents rushed to buy new homes in anticipation of higher prices in the future.
China's policymakers announced in December that "houses are for living in, not for speculating with" in its fight against rampant speculation in the property market.

Feature: Vietnamese dairy producers eyeing path to lucrative Chinese market

HANOI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Not satisfied with their own backyards, Vietnamese dairy producers are aiming at broadening their global reach, with neighboring China and its giant market topping the list of potential importers.
To Vu Ngoc Quynh, chairman of the Vietnam Dairy Association (VDA), said the more business trips he has taken to China, the more confident he becomes about the prospect of an import market.
"Chinese consumers have showed a very positive attitude towards Vietnamese dairy products," Quynh told Xinhua.
Over the past two years, local firm HanoiMilk has been participating in the annual Asia-China Expo held in Nanning City located in China's Guangxi province. HanoiMilk has been taking this as a precious opportunity to introduce their products to Chinese consumers.
"At the fair, we invited visitors to taste our products. Seeing people queuing in long lines to order our yogurt made us feel so happy," HanoiMilk's Chairman, Ha Quang Tuan, recalled.
According to Tuan, individual traders operating nearby the two countries' borders have imported a significant amount of Vietnamese dairy products into China since the Chinese people are amazingly fond of the goods.
The buyers' reaction encouraged HanoiMilk to build their first-ever plant in China, located in Pingxiang city in Guangxi province. The 2,000-square-meter plant uses advanced technology to package and preserve dairy products.
Tuan said the provincial authority is helping his firm to get approval from China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) to import dairy products from Vietnam to the country.
Like any other producer, Vietnam's largest milk firm Vinamilk considers China to be one of the most valuable potential markets in which it plans to invest further in manufacturing plants, farms and distribution channels.
To date, Vinamilk has boosted its overseas presence with production factories in Cambodia, New Zealand and the United States.
"China is a demanding market with the largest population in the world and its per capita income is increasing rapidly. Vinamilk's products have been welcome by local citizens due to their high quality, diversification and appropriate prices," Vinamilk's Director of External Affairs, Do Thanh Tuan, told Xinhua.
When asked about how Vietnamese products can compete in the Chinese market, local representatives expressed their optimism. They believe that the similarities in the tastes of both countries will help Vietnamese dairy products gain popularity among Chinese people.
"Like Vietnamese, Chinese consumers prefer yogurt in condensed form, which is different from products made in Europe or other Western countries," said Quynh.
In addition, the geographical factor will be an important advantage to Vietnamese products against other foreign brands.
"It is even closer from our factories to Chinese provinces nearby the border compared to the distance from Chinese firm's factories," Quynh said, pointing out the pros of cost and time efficiency while preserving and transporting products from Vietnam.
Speaking of the quality of the products and the confidence in the technology behind it, Tuan said, "We will compete fairly with local firms based on our high quality which meets global standards, but we'll ensure our prices are reasonable."
Across the expansive market, local brands dominate all provinces but people to some extent are becoming more trusting in products from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and South Korea, according to VDA.
"Our products have international standards like products from those countries, but are being sold at a relatively lower price. This is our competitiveness," asserted Quynh.
In the foreseeable future, the official import channel may be fully open to Vietnamese firms. The two governments have been seriously discussing about an agreement to allow imports of farm products from Vietnam to China.
"We are looking forward to the day China opens its doors, then the import procedures will be so much simpler," Quynh said.
Currently, a lack of such an agreement is causing delays and inconveniences for both importers and exporters, which also limits the size of trade deals.
"Paving the way for official imports is to serve the rights and demands of Chinese consumers and businesses who want to import and distribute made-in-Vietnam products," Tuan asserted, adding that a pilot scheme could be launched to control the sanitization of imports in the first stages and test the feasibility of the barrier-easing policy.

Economic Watch: Solid Q1 growth lifts full-year economic prospects

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- In the latest sign of economic stabilization, China reported better-than-expected growth for the first quarter of 2017.
The world's second-largest economy saw its gross domestic product (GDP) rise 6.9 percent year on year to hit 18.07 trillion yuan (2.63 trillion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, up from 6.8-percent growth in the previous quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
This beat previous market expectations of 6.8 percent and came well above the annual growth target of around 6.5 percent set in this year's government work report.
GATHERING MOMENTUM
NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong said the economy had achieved a rosy start for this year, attributing the strong performance mainly to robust factory activity, strong consumption and rebounding exports.
GDP was up 1.3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
"China's economic structure is improving and new momentum is gathering," Mao said, citing strong growth in the service sector and consumption.
Consumption contributed 77.2 percent of the GDP increase in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the service sector rose 7.7 percent year on year in the first quarter, outpacing a 3-percent increase in agriculture and 6.4 percent in the secondary industry. It accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy.
For the secondary industry, Mao said sectors such as advanced manufacturing are seeing better-than-average growth, while traditional sectors are also making improvements in quality and technology as the country's supply-side structural reform takes effect.
The job market remained stable, with 3.34 million new jobs created and the surveyed unemployment rate staying under 5 percent, NBS data showed.
STABLE TREND
Mao believes the Q1 data show that China has laid a solid foundation to achieve its full-year economic target, which was trimmed to around 6.5 percent from a range of 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016 to facilitate the country's structural adjustments.
While declining to predict the actual growth figures for the quarters ahead, Mao particularly stressed the increasing stability of China's economic performance and its untapped development potential.
"There will be steady reform dividends and the economy has enormous potential in the medium to long term," he said.
It is "no big deal" if economic growth slips by some tenths of a percentage point in the near future, he said, noting that China's economic growth rate has become less volatile in recent years, with 6.9 percent for 2015, 6.7 percent for 2016 and 6.9 percent for the first quarter of 2017.
Based on the stronger-than-expected data, investment bank J.P. Morgan raised its 2017 GDP growth forecast for China by 0.1 percentage points to 6.7 percent, citing broad-based strength across various sectors reflected in the data.
Though the bank expects GDP growth to ease moderately in the second quarter and even look for some further moderation in following quarters, there is still solid growth momentum for the rest of the year, said J.P. Morgan China economist Zhu Haibin.
OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS
While still cautious about future prospects, economists believe that the resilience reflected in the first-quarter figure will prompt stricter scrutiny in the financial sector, a move pushed by Chinese authorities to fend off systemic risks.
Authorities who were once concerned that strict regulation would dampen economic growth will no longer hesitate to take stronger measures in financial and real estate controls, said Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities.
The higher growth is "important for containing financial risks," which makes the problem of excess leverage look more manageable, according to Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg.
Looking ahead, Orlik said China's real estate controls will ultimately take a toll on economic growth, and uncertain trade ties with the U.S. could hurt exports.
Mao admitted that the influence of China's property controls will gradually become evident in April and the following months as they were only introduced in mid-March.
"It is fair to say the housing market outlook is a major uncertainty for the economic outlook this year," said Zhu of J.P. Morgan.
Though extreme movements in the housing market are not expected, given the importance of the housing market, even modest upside or downside risks to the housing market could affect the trajectory of growth forecasts, he said.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares fell Monday, with Xiongan-related stocks having a mixed performance after resuming trading.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.74 percent lower at 3,222.17 points, and the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.66 percent lower at 10,450.86 points.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board, lost 1.02 percent to close at 1,868.28 points.
A number of shares related to the Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing, including construction firms and companies in the vicinity of the area, suspended trading last week, after days of consecutive gains pushed their stock prices significantly higher.
On April 1, China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, which authorities described as a "major historic and strategic choice" that would be "crucial for the millennium to come," with related stocks rising after the announcement. After resuming trading, over 10 stocks plummeted by the daily limit of 10 percent during Monday morning trading, signaling receding fever after regulators moved to clamp down on speculation.
Juli Sling was among the stocks that saw prices fall by the daily limit on the first day of resuming trading, after surging by the 10 percent limit for six consecutive trading days before trading was suspended.
Meanwhile, several other related stocks, including Tangshan Jidong Equipment And Engineering and Hebei Sailhero Environmental Protection High-tech, maintained strong momentum by rising the maximum limit.
Losses narrowed near closing, as the market was dragged up by surging financial heavyweights during afternoon trading.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people's disposable income expanded at a faster pace than economic growth in the first quarter of this year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Monday.
Per capita nominal disposable income of Chinese nationwide rose 8.5 percent in the first three months from a year ago, and per capita real disposable income after taking into consideration the effects of inflation increased 7 percent, outpacing the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.9 percent in the period, NBS figures showed.
Breakdown figures showed that urban residents' per capita real disposable income grew 6.3 percent year on year in the first quarter to 9,986 yuan (about 1,452 U.S. dollars), while per capita disposable income of rural residents rose at a faster pace of 7.2 percent in the period to 3,880 yuan.
Other indicators released by the NBS on Monday, including fixed-asset investment and industrial production, pointed to stabilization in the world's second-largest economy.
NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong said the economy had achieved a rosy start this year and the income gap between rural and urban residents narrowed, laying a solid foundation to realizing its full-year economic target.
The government trimmed this year's growth goal to around 6.5 percent from a range of 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, expanded 6.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, compared with the 6.3-percent increase for January to February, official data showed Monday.
The 6.8-percent growth was up from the 5.8-percent increase in the same period of 2016. It was also higher than the 6-percent annual gain seen in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Industrial output, officially called industrial value added, is used to measure the activity of designated large enterprises with annual turnover of at least 20 million yuan (2.9 million U.S. dollars).
In March, industrial production expanded 7.6 percent year on year, NBS data showed.
Ownership analysis showed that industrial output of state-holding enterprises was up 6.2 percent in the first quarter, while output of joint-stock enterprises grew 6.9 percent. Meanwhile, industrial output of enterprises funded by overseas investors increased 6.9 percent.
In breakdown, manufacturing output expanded 7.4 percent in the first quarter, accelerating from the 6.9 percent growth in the first two months. Mining output growth declined 2.4 percent year on year.
"The structure of China's industrial output continues to improve," said NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong at a press conference, citing Q1 industrial output growth of the high-tech manufacturing sector reaching 13.4 percent and robust profit gains of large firms.
Industrial enterprises above the designated size reaped profits of 1.02 trillion yuan in the first two months, representing an increase of 31.5 percent year on year, and the growth pace quickened by 23 percentage points from last year.
The industrial output figures were released by the NBS along with a slew of other major economic indicators in the first quarter.
China's economy posted a forecast-beating growth rate in the first quarter of 2017, with the gross domestic product (GDP) up 6.9 percent from a year ago.
The growth was well above the full-year target of 6.5 percent and the 6.8-percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to NBS.

FAW Car to open sales shops for Hongqi H7

CHANGCHUN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- FAW, China's oldest automaker, plans to open 21 sales shops for Hongqi, or "Red Flag," the country's homegrown car brand, as it is striving to expand into the private car market.
Du Xiaodong, general manager of FAW Hongqi Sales Co. Ltd., said the Hongqi H7 was aimed at the high-end car market.
He said that Hongqi would debut the fashionable H5 model and a renovated version of its flagship H7 model, with both hitting the market later this year, at the upcoming Shanghai Auto Show from April 21 to 28.
Du said 95 percent of Hongqi's first group of 21 sales shops would be run by auto dealers listed as in the country's top 100, with a background in selling premium brands.
Du said that by 2020 Hongqi would have eight models ranging from large family cars to compact cars and SUVs.
FAW's were originally built as official limousines. In 2013, when Foreign Minister Wang Yi abandoned his Audi A6 for the Hongqi H7 sedan, the industry anticipated a new dawn for Chinese brands, but only 3,000 H7s were sold that year.
Industrial insiders said that Hongqi products lack variety. Its flagship H7 model does not have solid market positioning, as it seeks both the business and private car market. In December 2016, only 1,001 Hongqi cars were sold.
Currently Hongqi has 22 showrooms nationwide, where H7 cars are the only exhibit.
Xu Ping, chair of FAW, said Hongqi represented self-dependent innovation, which would continue to be the principal of the brand's development.
FAW unveiled its first Hongqi SUV, the Hongqi LS5, in 2015, with a 4.0t twin-turboc engine and an eight-speed tiptronic. The company plans to adjust the brand to cater to younger customers.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's economy posted a forecast-beating growth rate in the first quarter of 2017, with GDP up 6.9 percent from a year ago, official data showed Monday.
The reading, the quickest increase in 18 months, was above the full-year target of 6.5 percent and the 6.8-percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
GDP reached 18.07 trillion yuan (2.63 trillion U.S. dollars) in the January-March period.
NBS spokesperson Mao Shengyong said the economy had achieved a rosy start this year, during Monday's conference.
"Generally speaking, the national economy has continued with stable and sound momentum in the first quarter as growth rebounded moderately and economic adjustment was steadily promoted," Mao said.
He mainly attributed the strong performance to robust factory activity, strong consumption and rebounding exports.
GDP was up 1.3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
Beside the headline figures, other major indicators also showed a resilient economy.
The value-added industrial output expanded 6.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, compared with the 5.8-percent increase in the same period a year ago, and the fixed-asset investment grew 9.2 percent, quickening from the 8.1 percent registered in the whole 2016.
China's disposable income per capita stood at 7,184 yuan in the first three months, with nominal year-on-year growth of 8.5 percent. The increase was 7 percent if taking account of inflation.
The job market remained stable, with 3.34 million new jobs created and the surveyed unemployment rate staying under 5 percent.
"China's economic structure is improving and new momentum is gathering," Mao said.
The service sector rose 7.7 percent year on year in the first quarter, outpacing a 3-percent increase in agriculture and 6.4 percent in the secondary industry. It accounted for 56.5 percent of the overall economy.
Consumption, another significant driver of economic growth, contributed to 77.2 percent of the GDP increase in the first quarter.
Mao said the Q1 data showed that China had laid a solid foundation to realize its full-year economic target, but still warned of risks from an complicated external environment and domestic structural problems.
The government trimmed this year's growth goal to around 6.5 percent last month from a range of 6.5 to 7 percent for 2016, a move expected to provide more wiggle room for reforms.
The world's second largest economy rose 6.7 percent year on year in 2016, the weakest annual expansion in 26 years but still an enviable pace around the globe.
Mao expressed his confidence on China's economic outlook, citing increasing stability and untapped growth potential.
"There will be steady reform dividend and the economy has enormous potential in the medium to long term," he said.
Despite the encouraging data, Chinese shares were surprisingly bearish as the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index opened lower Monday and slipped 1.32 percent to 3,203.21 points during the morning session.
The central parity rate of the Chinese yuan weakened 45 basis points to 6.8785 against the U.S. dollar.

Commentary: China remains powerhouse for world growth

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Once again, the naysayers were proved wrong by China's better-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter, and they might also be surprised by the economy's optimized structure.
Official data showed that China's GDP increased 6.9 percent year on year to hit 18.07 trillion yuan (2.63 trillion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, beating estimates of 6.8 percent.
The growth was above the full-year target of "around 6.5 percent" and the 6.8-percent increase registered in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
China has served as an important stabilizer of the world economy and powerhouse for global growth. Against the backdrop of a sluggish world economy, China's GDP expanded 6.7 percent year on year in 2016, contributing to more than 30 percent of global economic growth, much higher than each of the other major economies.
With expanded economic size, the 6.9-percent growth in Q1 represented around 30 percent of global growth in the first three months.
Although China has geared down to a medium-high level of growth under the "new normal," those betting on a collapse in China could be unwise because the country's economic fundamentals are sound and structure is optimizing despite the slowdown.
In the first quarter, industrial output, fixed-asset investment, retail sales and employment all held steady, providing a solid foundation for growth.
Meanwhile, supply-side structural reform was intensified as efforts in cutting overcapacity, reducing inventory, deleveraging, lowering costs and strengthening weak links have made progress.
The economic structure is becoming more sustainable and new drivers for growth are posting a stronger presence.
The industrial structure is increasingly dominated by the service sector and consumption, a very different situation from the previous over-reliance on the industrial sector and investment.
In the first quarter, the value added of the tertiary industry accounted for 56.5 percent of GDP, 17.8 percentage points higher than that of the secondary industry.
New driving forces grew fast in Q1. The value added of strategic and emerging industries rose by 10.3 percent year on year, 3.5 percentage points faster than that of the industrial enterprises above a designated size.
Moreover, growth became greener. Energy consumption per unit of GDP dropped by 3.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Looking ahead, China will continue to be the powerhouse of world growth despite challenges including financial risks.
"As it enters the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), the Chinese economy continues to grow fast by international standards. While growth is slowing gradually, GDP per capita remains on course to almost double between 2010 and 2020. As a result, the Chinese economy will remain the major driver of global growth for the foreseeable future," said the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its 2017 Economic Survey of China.
"However, China's growth model has led to misallocation of capital and falling investment efficiency, and to excess capacity in some manufacturing industries and in the real estate sector, which needs to be worked off," the OECD warned.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China created 3.34 million new jobs in the first quarter of the year, an official said Monday.
"The figure was 160,000 higher than the number created in the same period last year," said Mao Shengyong, spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, at a press conference.
China's employment situation was generally good in the first quarter this year, with the unemployment rate in 31 major Chinese cities staying under 5 percent at the end of March, according to Mao.
"Meanwhile, more workers from rural areas found jobs in urban areas in the first two months, an increase of 2.7 percent year on year," Mao said.
China aims to create more than 11 million jobs this year, 1 million more than last year's target, according to this year's government work report.
The country added 13.14 million jobs in 2016, and the registered urban jobless rate stood at 4.02 percent at the end of the year.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's retail sales rose 10 percent year on year in the first quarter of the year, 0.4 percentage points less than the whole of last year, official data showed Monday.
Retail sales of consumer goods totaled 8.5823 trillion yuan (1.25 trillion U.S. dollars) during the January-March period, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
In March, total sales of consumer goods rose 10.9 percent year on year, 1.4 percentage points faster than the first two months, which rose 9.5 percent year on year, the first time for growth to fall below 10 percent in 11 years.
The data showed strong consumption potential in rural areas, with retail sales expanding 11.9 percent during the period, outpacing urban areas, where retail sales climbed 9.7 percent year on year.
Online sales continued strong growth, surging 32.1 percent in the first two months to 1,404.5 billion yuan.
China is trying to shift its economy toward a growth model driven by consumer spending, innovation and services, while weaning it off reliance on exports and investment.
As a main driver of economic growth, consumption contributed to 64.6 percent of China's GDP growth last year. The country has vowed to promote a steady increase in consumer spending this year.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's energy intensity, the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP, decreased 3.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.
The decline was faster than the target set in the government work report last month that energy consumption per unit of GDP should be cut by at least 3.4 percent in 2017.
China's energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 5 percent last year, according to the report.
China's total energy consumption will be capped at 5 billion tonnes of coal equivalent by 2020, according to a government plan for 2016 to 2020. This will amount to a 15 percent reduction of energy use per unit of GDP by 2020.

BUENOS AIRES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentina plans to boost small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) with Chinese financial cooperation, state daily Telam said on Sunday.
The 150 million U.S.-dollar development agreement was struck between Argentina's Investment and Foreign Trade Bank (BICE) and the China Development Bank (CDB).
"The financing agreement reached with the CDB is very important, since accords with international agencies allow us to offer loans with very beneficial terms to Argentina's SMBs," BICE's president, Pablo garcia, said in a statement.
The financing will be provided in parts, with an initial outlay of 50 million dollars, and will be earmarked to help small and medium-scale enterprises in the fields of renewable energy, energy infrastructure and agricultural manufacturing, among others, Telam said.
The agreement between BICE and the CDB is not solely financial, comprising also "cooperation between the two institutions to promote good international practices and to strengthen ties between Argentine and Asian companies," the agency said.

Trump right about "China not currency manipulator": expert

Editor: An
PHILADELPHIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Geoffrey Garrett, an American political economist, said U.S. President Donald Trump was right not to label China as "currency manipulator," a term reflecting one of several misconceptions from the West about the Chinese economy.
"In fact, the People's Bank of China has been trying hard to keep up the value of the Chinese RMB in the past few years," Garrett said, rebutting the argument prevalent among American publics that Beijing has been manipulating its currency and driving the value down.
The expert, who heads the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, gave the remarks while addressing the Penn Wharton China Summit opened here Saturday.
He observed that the RMB depreciated "the least" against the U.S. dollar compared to other major currencies over the past three years, hence "it is in fact doing the best job in maintaining value against the dollar," he said.
Trump said Wednesday during an interview with the Wall Street Journal that China is not currency manipulator, reversing his tune voiced in the presidential campaign, blaming Beijing for intentionally keeping its currency low to gain competitiveness in exports.
To Garrett, branding China as a currency manipulator is one of several misleading observations about Chinese economy by Americans, along with the hype about the slowdown of Chinese economy and the overemphasis on the U.S. trade deficit with China.
He said there are "understandable and very good reasons" for China's economic slowdown, one of which is that it helped the country gain sustainable and high-quality growth.
In addition, the expert said China's contribution to global growth is "way higher than it has ever been." He considered a country's contribution to global growth the "real important indicator" of the world economy.
Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed Washington's goods trade deficit with Beijing reached 347 billion dollars in 2016, significantly higher than that of other U.S. trade partners. However, Garrett said the number "is narrowly true but misses a lot of things."
"Chinese goods are produced more efficiently than they would have been in the United States," he said, adding that it is the American consumers who have benefited the most from the current situation, since they get to buy high-quality goods in much lower prices.
Garrett concluded that the commonly seen headlines in U.S. media about the Chinese economy were usually "profoundly misleading about the win-win nature of the relations between the United States and China," adding that drastic changes in bilateral relations following the election of Trump, once much anticipated, actually didn't happen.
Founded in 2016, the annual Penn Wharton China Summit is one of the most widely attended conferences that focus on China in the American academia. This year's event has attracted high-profile guest speakers as well as hundreds of audience from across the world.

by Xinhua writers Yan Liang, Zheng Kaijun
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- One of today's most technically-advanced ships in the world set sail from here on Sunday to retrace the oldest maritime route that linked China with the rest of the world.
Merchant Vessel (M.V.) COSCO Netherlands is leaving Yangshan Deep Water Port at 7 p.m. local time (1100 GMT), in Shanghai, the world's largest cargo port, and will dock in the Port of Ningbo in east China, the Port of Singapore, the Suez Canal, the Pireaus Port in Greece, and ports in Rotterdam of Netherlands, Hamburg of Germany, and Antwerp of Belgium, in its about 40-day journey.
Products with internationally well-known brand, like Hewlett-Packard (HP) computers, Sony LCD monitors, Hisense TV, Haier refrigerators, automobile spare parts and bicycles, assembled or made in China, are on board for export to northwestern European and other countries.
An over 150,000 ton oceangoing container vessel, the giant is 366-meter long, 51.2-meter wide and 67-meter high, and can carry up to 13,386 TEU (20 foot equivalent unit). It was manufactured by China's Nantong COSCO KHI Ship Engineering Co., Ltd. in 2013.
China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited, owner of M.V. COSCO Netherlands, offers service on more than 100 routes globally, including those from the Far East to northwestern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Africa, as well as regional feeders within Europe and Southeast Asia nations. Part of the route that M.V.COSCO Netherlands travels overlaps with the ancient Maritime Silk Road and its history can be traced back to ancient time.
Yao Wei, a 30-year-oldspider engine room engineman from Jiangsu Province, first time on board M.V. COSCO Netherlands, told Xinhua, "I am very looking forward to this new journey, from history to reality, from China to Europe. It must be very impressive."
The ancient Maritime Silk Road was a crucial conduit for trade and cultural exchanges between China's southeastern coastal regions and countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.
It was first formed in the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 B.C.-220 A.D.), developed from the Three Kingdoms Period to Sui Dynasty (220-618 A.D.), flourished in the Tang and Song Dynasties (618-1279 A.D.), and fell into decline in the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911 A.D.).
Through the sea route, silk, tea and china were exported, while spices and rare treasures like precious stones were brought to China.
During the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.), renowned Italian traveler and explorer Marco Polo headed for China along the Silk Road. After living in China for 17 years, he left from Quanzhou, a coastal city in southeast China's Fujian Province, or one of the starting points of the ancient Maritime Silk Road.
Marco Polo's remarks and memories of China were recorded in the book -- the Travels of Marco Polo, which described China's politics, economy, culture and prosperity in detail at that time.
As ancient trade through sailing driven by monsoons and ocean currents gave way to the transoceanic trade via container freighters between China and Europe, the Maritime Silk Road has also witnessed the growth of cultural exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations.
Now, the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, or together the Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, aim to build an even stronger trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes and promote common development among all countries involved.
In May this year, China will host the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, during which participants will have an opportunity to explore cooperation opportunities, build cooperation platforms and share the outcomes of cooperation.

 

China tightens financial conditions more visibly to stem asset bubbles: CICC

2017-04-16 17:41:25
Editor: xuxin
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A notable deceleration of China's credit expansion indicates a more prudent monetary policy stance enabling it to address inflating asset bubbles, according to a recent report by China International Capital Corp. (CICC).
Adjusted growth of total social financing (TSF), a more comprehensive measure of the speed for credit expansion, decelerated notably to 15.6 percent in March from 16.4 percent in February.
Money market rates also climbed higher. The weighted average interbank offered rate and pledged repo rate edged up to 2.62 percent and 2.84 percent, respectively, in March.
"The tightening of financial conditions in March was likely driven by the quarter-end MPA, but it may have also resulted from a more prudent monetary policy stance and further policy efforts toward financial deleveraging," the report noted.
Apart from raising the reverse repo rates in March, the central bank has also stepped up financial deleveraging efforts.
In the meantime, China Banking regulatory Commission (CBRC) has also issued stricter regulations towards interbank transactions and off-balance-sheet financing.
"We would continue to closely monitor the change in adjusted TSF growth and interbank rates to gauge the (tightening) effect of these new policies, as the execution of the new regulations holds the key to maintaining a stable financial market during the intricate financial deleveraging process," according to the report.
"However, we do not expect prolonged and excessive tightening of financial conditions in the near future, as CPI inflation is expected to remain low and the regulators have vowed to maintain financial market stability throughout the financial deleveraging process," it added.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies secured 286 merges and acquisitions (M&A) deals in March, a hefty increase of 51.3 percent from a month ago, according to a market report.
The available data on transaction value totaled 13.44 billion U.S. dollars, up 4.6 percent from February, according to a report by a research outfit under Zero21PO Group, a service provider and investment institution.
Measured by value, over 90 percent of the deals took place in China. Some 122 deals were closed in the manufacturing sector, or 42.7 percent of the total. Those transactions were valued at 3.76 billion U.S. dollars, or a 28 percent share.
The research firm noted that although manufacturing deals rose remarkably in quantity, there remained huge room to improve in quality.
With favorable government policy, the manufacturing sector is likely to push forward structural upgrades to make it more competitive, the report added.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite speculation to the contrary, the U.S. government has decided not to brand China a currency manipulator. After seeking truth from facts, the United States has chosen a direction that will benefit the two economies and the world at large.
In a semiannual report to the U.S. Congress published late Friday, the Treasury Department declared that no major trading partner of the U.S., including China, was manipulating its currency.
While it is a sharp reversal from the rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign trail, nearly three months into his presidency, this different tone chimes with a more realistic view of China's currency.
It shows his tough talk on China was only campaign rhetoric, said Wei Benhua, a senior researcher at Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University.
Economists have argued that China currently does not merit the label of currency manipulator, and the Chinese currency, RMB, has been at equilibrium level in recent years.
The Treasury uses three measures to decide if a country is being manipulated: whether the country runs a sizeable surplus in trade with America; whether its current-account surplus exceeds 3 percent of GDP; and whether it spends more than 2 percent a year to buy foreign assets to suppress the value of its currency.
China only meets the first criteria by running over 20 billion U.S. dollars of trade surplus with the United States, said Zhu Jianfang, chief economist with the Citic Securities.
China has spared no efforts to keep the RMB at a stable level over the past few years; exactly the opposite of currency manipulation, he added.
Over the last decade, China's effective exchange rate has appreciated more than any other major currency, rising more than 40 percent, said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Brad Setser, a researcher with the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that the RMB exchange rate is now close to equilibrium. He expects the RMB will remain stable at the current level with China's current account surplus and its efforts to deal with capital outflows.
The U.S. administration's new stance on the currency issue was likely influenced by the recent meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Florida, where they were able to better understand each other, said Zhao Xijun, a finance professor with Renmin University.
With the currency spat subduing, economists said the chance of a trade war between the world's two largest economies will be slim at most.
"The possibility of a trade war could be ruled out as the U.S. government has dropped the manipulator claim, " Zhu Jianfang said, adding the two countries have huge space for cooperation, which is good for both sides.
"It would be hard for me to imagine a full on trade war between the U.S. and China as it would be too damaging to the two greatest economies in the world, and it could easily pull the rest of the world into the biggest recession we will ever see," said John Ling, president of the Council of American States in China.
As many of the new U.S. cabinet members have experience in the private sector working with China, he said, it was a positive sign that there would be disputes and issues, but both sides will try to maintain a relationship that will benefit the citizens in both countries.
Economists also foresee that the news will help keep the RMB stable.
It seems the market was given a stable expectation for the RMB trading and big fluctuations of the RMB will not occur, as the market could always be greatly influenced by significant government talks, Zhao Xijun said.
Observers also said the RMB's exchange rate is essentially decided by China's economic fundamentals which currently do not warrant a weaker RMB.
Thanks to China's consistent efforts to allow the market to decide the exchange rates, the International Monetary Fund declared the RMB as no longer undervalued in 2015.
Under Obama administration, the Treasury also dropped its previous assessment that the RMB was "significantly undervalued".

China securities watchdog urges stock exchanges to toughen supervision

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock exchanges should conduct supervision over listed firms more proactively, the country's securities watchdog said Saturday.
It is the responsibility of stock exchanges to be supervising IPOs, mergers and the reorganization and delisting of listed firms, according to Liu Shiyu, head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
"All players are subject to the supervision of stock exchanges, not only members and listed firms, but also involved intermediary institutions such as accounting firms," Liu told a general meeting of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
Compared with administrative supervision and self-discipline, Liu pointed out that stock exchanges have the advantages of offering more comprehensive and effective supervision.
"Stock exchanges should punish market irregularities without mercy," Liu added.
The CSRC has been toughening supervision and punishment of illegal market activities such as insider trading and stock manipulation after the market rout in 2015 shattered investor confidence.
Last month, the CSRC slapped a 3.47 billion yuan fine on a company chairman for stock market manipulation, a record high.

China still faces challenging trade outlook, official

GUANGZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China faces a complex and grim trade outlook which is not likely to improve anytime soon, a senior commerce official warned, despite buoyant trade figures in the first quarter.
China's foreign trade retained robust growth in Q1 to reach 6.2 trillion yuan (about 902.47 billion U.S. dollars) in volume, up 21.8 percent year on year.
Vice Commerce Minister Fang Aiqing said at the opening of the 121st China Import and Export Fair, known as the Canton Fair, that factors of uncertainty and instability have notably increased facing China's trade and these difficulties are not short-termed.
Fang, however, said the fundamentals for China's trade development had not changed and the industries between China and developed and developing countries remain complementary.
He said China will continue to push for structural adjustment in trade, carry on innovative reform, coordinate the balanced development of trade and investment, and maintain the stabilizing trend of trade.
The Canton Fair is held every spring and autumn and is seen as a barometer of the country's foreign trade.
The current event will run through to May 5. Nearly 25,000 domestic and foreign companies set up booths.
Xu Bing, spokesperson for the fair, said optimism prevailed as traders were enthusiastic, based on an organizer's pre-event survey and air ticket booking information.
Li Xinghao, president of Chigo Air Conditioning, is one of the upbeat businessman.
He said the company's export of corporate air conditioners grew by 20 percent in Q1 and the trend was expected to continue throughout the year. He attributed the bright prospects to the integration of cloud computing and big data into the manufacturing of air conditioners.

China central bank official urges efforts to boost green financing

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A central bank official on Saturday said green financing must be improved as the country seeks greener and more sustainable growth.
In a speech delivered at a meeting on green financing, vice governor of the central bank Chen Yulu said China's green financing is still at an early stage and it has the potential to be more effective.
The investment returns on some green projects are not attractive enough, and some fields still face financing difficulties and high financing costs, Chen noted, calling for a coordinated role between the government and the market to promote green financing.
China should encourage local governments to set up green funds and work together with social capital to bring down financing costs, Chen suggested.
Innovation for financing products and services should be boosted to speed up development of green bonds, green asset-backed securitization, green indices and green insurance to offer diverse products to investors.
China should also enhance transparency in the green financing market and deepen international cooperation in the area, according to Chen.
China is pushing the development of green finance to support its industrial upgrading and anti-pollution campaign.
According to credit rating agency Moody's, green bond issues worldwide hit a record high of 93.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2016, rising 120 percent from a year earlier, bolstered by China-based issuers.
China accounted for nearly 40 percent of new green bonds last year, followed by the United States, France and Germany, according to Moody's.

NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Both China and the United States have the opportunity to do well if they further open investment and trade to each other, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew said Friday.
Lew said that China will benefit from increased U.S. investment in service sectors such as finance and insurance, while the United States could benefit from foreign direct investment from China, which helps create jobs.
"It shouldn't be a zero-sum game," he said at the 6th Columbia China Prospects Conference that opened on Friday.
"One thing I know for sure is that given the size of the U.S. and Chinese economies, the world is watching the two of us because everyone has a stake in our individual and joint success," Lew said.
On the U.S.-China trade deficit, Lew said the actual bilateral trade deficit number is not always the issue. "You have to separate goods and services from financial flows and investment," he said.
The two countries' trade imbalance is easing as middle-income Chinese generate a huge demand for imported products, according to both U.S. and Chinese official data.
Meanwhile, Lew said the two countries should cooperate to address issues concerning excess capacity and the investment environment in the future.
With regard to the currency issue, Lew noted that the Donald Trump administration made an important decision based on facts and analysis not to designate China as a currency manipulator.
"Based on facts and analyses it will be difficult to reach a different conclusion. But it is important that the facts and analyses govern the decision," he said.
Trump on Wednesday said his administration would not label China a currency manipulator.

CHANGCHUN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese-made self-driving truck has passed a navigation test, heralding the era of intelligent, automated heavy vehicles.
FAW Jiefang, the leading truck manufacturer, debuted the self-driving truck at FAW Tech Center in Changchun City, Jilin Province. The truck was able to recognize obstacles, slow down, make a detour, and speed up.
The truck reacted correctly to traffic lights, adaptive cruise control, remote commands and successfully overtook, company sources said.
FAW Jiefang now plans to commercialize the intelligent driving vehicle as early as 2018.
Hu Hanjie, FAW Jiefang general manager, said the company has built a whole industry chain partnership to develop, manufacture, sell, and service self-driving trucks. The participation of more firms across the sector will accelerate the technology's use on heavy-duty vehicles, Hu said.
Leading Chinese tech firms, including Baidu and Tencent, have invested in self-driving entities. Baidu, for example, has tested driverless mini cars at the annual World Internet Conference for the last two years.
Industry insiders, however, said the technology may prove more practical when it is used on trucks than private cars as truck drivers are more likely to drive tired. The new systems could cut operational costs by replacing drivers.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's centrally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have voiced support for Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, pledging efforts to participate in its construction.
Telecom giants China Unicom, China Mobile and China Telecom said they would offer advanced communication services to the area, supported by innovative models such as cloud computing, big data and e-commerce.
China Mobile and China Telecom will make sure Xiongan is covered by a 5G network.
Wang Yupu, chairman of oil giant Sinopec, said the company will increase investment into geothermal energy in Hebei, and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) plans to focus on natural gas businesses in the region.
China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) joined the chorus of support, promising a plentiful supply of clean energy to the region.
Other state firms, including China Guodian Corp., and China Huaneng Group, also pledged to contribute to the construction of the new area.
The plan for Xiongan New Area was officially announced on April 1. The new area will span Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin counties in Hebei Province, eventually covering 2,000 square kilometers, with a population of 2 to 2.5 million.
Chinese leaders hope the new area will help address the severe "urban ills" of traffic congestion and air pollution in Beijing, by curbing the capital's population growth and moving non-capital functions out of Beijing.
China's top SOEs regulator on Friday announced it would establish a special working group to encourage state firms to map out future development strategies for the area.
"The centrally administered SOEs have been encouraged to support the construction of the zone in areas like energy security, infrastructure, electricity, telecommunications, rail transport, ecological protection, information-based network and smart city," noted the statement from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese drone manufacturer DJI-Innovations, a world leader with a 70-percent share of the global market, is poised to expand in Latin America over the next few years, as it proves to be multi-functional in various fields.
Based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, DJI, already well known for its Phantom drone, expects its new range of models designed for the corporate sector to help boost sales growth in the region.
"We have seen notable growth of clients in the market segment for inspections of electrical and telephone lines, and also in agriculture," said DJI's regional director Manuel Martinez.
Online sales of DJI drones in Latin America began in 2014, but the company had no physical presence in the region until January 2016, so its sales share is still "quite below other markets such as China and the United States, which are constantly vying for the first place, followed by Europe," Martinez said.
China and the United States currently constitute 60 percent of the company's sales, with Europe accounting for 30 percent, and the remaining 10 percent are shared by the rest of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America -- but not for long. The company expects Latin American sales to catch up with those of Europe.
"We know that the business sector will be the market segment with the largest growth in Latin America. Compared with China, the United States and Asia, where sales are driven more by the recreational segment, the corporate sector accounts for some 97 percent of drone sales in Latin America," said Martinez.
The region's "very high tax burden" discourages average citizens from purchasing drones, he said.
"Here, drones are a corporate thing. The only markets where you see more recreational drones are Chile and Mexico, because Chile has free-trade agreements and Mexico borders on the United States. In the rest of the Latin American countries, drones are for business, inspections, the agricultural segment and for recordings," said Martinez.
DJI is catering to that market, "launching products that are in great demand for expeditions and for agriculture," he said, referring to products including drone-equipped cameras used in mining and inspection of buildings for damage.
"The drone detects problems, providing companies with greater security and saving their money," he said.
For the agricultural sector, DJI has its "Agras line of spraying machines, which can't replace planes, but can do high precision tasks," said Martinez.
After planes finish spraying, drones can be sent in to detect problems, missed spots and concentrations of blight, and deliver the extra spraying needed.
"Uruguay is the first country in the region to fully develop a government policy that will allow it to become the first to develop a drone-based services industry," said Martinez. "It is the first country in the world with an official state policy (regarding drones)."
In Brazil, firefighters are putting DJI's drones "to very nice use," said Martinez.
DJI has formed a "strategic partnership with firefighters" in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, training them to use drones in search and rescue operations, and to detect mosquito breeding grounds that can spread diseases like dengue, he said.
In business for 11 years, DJI "launched drones designed for recreation, fun, photographs," and by 2015, its drones, all made in China, have generated 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, according to Martinez.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 45 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were added to China's New Third Board over the past week, latest data showed.
The newcomers brought the total number of companies listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotation (NEEQ) system to 11,070.
Weekly turnover on the board was about 5.24 billion yuan (about 762.7 million U.S. dollars) during the period, up 39.7 percent from a week ago.
The NEEQ debuted in 2006 as an experimental platform for small, non-listed high-tech enterprises in Zhongguancun Science Park, Beijing. The present system was officially established on Jan. 16, 2013.
It complements the country's existing stock exchanges, the SME board and the ChiNext board. The board is seen as an easy financing channel with low costs and simple listing procedures.

China's fiscal revenue growth to slow in second quarter: CICC

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's fiscal revenue growth is likely to slow in the second quarter of 2017 as the factors that supported strong expansion since the start of the year will gradually weaken, according to a recent report by China International Capital Corp. (CICC).
Official data showed China's fiscal revenue rose 14.1 percent year on year to 4.44 trillion yuan (645.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter.
The growth slightly retreated from the 14.9-percent gain seen in the January-February period, but was still markedly above the 4.5-percent rate in 2016.
The report by CICC macro team attributed the momentum to the pickup in the domestic economy that boosted growth in corporate profits and related tax revenues, as well as the rise in prices.
But as the gain in industrial price moderated recently and import growth is likely to slow, fiscal revenue growth in the second quarter is likely to slow, the report pointed out.
Prices of industrial prices are already showing signs of losing steam. China's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 7.6 percent year on year in March, retreating from the 7.8 percent growth registered in February.
Meanwhile, the property tightening policies introduced by cities since March will dampen the growth of property transaction-related tax revenue, and the advance collection of business tax in April and May 2016 will push up the base for fiscal revenue growth in the next two months, according to the report.
This year China's fiscal deficit is projected to be 3 percent of GDP, or 2.38 trillion yuan, according to the government work report last month.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market regulator has approved the initial public offering (IPO) applications of 10 companies.
The companies will be allowed to raise up to 5.1 billion yuan (about 741.9 million U.S. dollars), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement.
Six companies will be listed on the Shanghai bourse, one on the Shenzhen small- and medium-enterprise board and three on the ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board.
The 10 firms and their underwriters will confirm the dates for the IPOs and publish prospectuses following discussions with the exchanges.
Under the current IPO system, new shares are subject to approval from the CSRC, which controls both the timing and pricing.
China is working on transforming its IPO approval system into one based on registration, which will allow the bourses to take over IPO approvals and clear the backlog of waiting companies.

Across China: Industry city sets example of action in pollution control

LANZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It was with some reluctance that Ma Xiaobing upgraded his kebab stall by investing in a smoke control device, but he is doing much better business now.
"In the past, we roasted four legs of lamb each day. Currently, we need about 20 a day," said Ma of Lanzhou, Gansu Province. "There are more diners and we are busier than ever."
Lanzhou, a city in the Yellow River valley in the country's arid northwest, was once among China's most polluted cities. Pollution was so bad that people even joked that the town did not show up on satellite images.
Strong pollution control measures have lowered PM10 and PM2.5 densities in the city to less than 75 percent of 2013 levels. Last year, the annual number of blue sky days increased by 50 to reach 243.
The provincial capital has become "a model of air quality improvement," according to a central inspection team. Annual coal consumption in the city has been reduced from 10 million tonnes in 2012 to around six million tonnes last year.
One of the things Lanzhou has done is to rally grassroots officials into the battle. Yang Mingyan, a subdistrict office clerk, is one of the 10,000 pollution supervisors in the city.
"Every morning, I check the area I am responsible for to see who is burning what, and whether substandard coal or wood are being used. If I find a problem, I will ask whoever is responsible to stop. If they will not listen to me, I report the matter to superior authorities."
All cities have anti-pollution policies, but in Lanzhou these policies are very strictly imposed.
"Some cities are afraid or unable to deal with big companies in environmental protection for fear it will affect their economy, but Lanzhou has no such problem," said Xing Lifeng, deputy director of Lanzhou environmental protection bureau.
The bureau even fined a leading state-owned petrochemical enterprise and has asked some companies to apologize to citizens.
Some officials were punished for failing to properly apply themselves to their pollution control duties while others who showed more enthusiasm were promoted.
"In fact, many of our measures are not very innovative, but in Lanzhou polluters are subject to the full force of the law." said Xing.
Some heavily polluted cities, such as Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou, have sent officials to Lanzhou to study its experiences first hand.
Many of Lanzhou's successes could easily be transplanted to other places, said Ma Jianmin of Lanzhou University.
For example, online monitoring data is all well and good, but it is standard practice in Lanzhou for personnel to actually visit big polluters and see for themselves exactly what is going on, he said.
The government expects good air quality days to account for more than 80 percent in all cities at prefectural level and above by 2020. It's an ambitious target, and one that has not been met yet in Lanzhou.
"Lanzhou still has some way to go to meet the goal. Pollution decreases initially by dealing with that which is easiest to control. Pollution control is therefore increasingly difficult and our work becomes harder with every success," said Chen Yimin, a Lanzhou environmental official.

U.S. Treasury says China does not manipulate its currency

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Department on Friday declared that no major trading partner of the U.S., including China, met the standard of manipulating its currency, while six economies were listed on its Monitoring List as their foreign exchange polices bear close monitoring.
In its Semi-Annual Report to Congress on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies, the Treasury Department concluded that no major trading partner of the United States, including China, has manipulated their currencies over the past six months to keep them undervalued.
However, it put China, China's Taiwan, Japan, South Korea,, Germany, and Switzerland on its Monitoring List, saying their foreign exchange policies bear close monitoring.
The report said that China remained on the list because of its "disproportionate share of the overall U.S. trade deficit," despite that China's current account surplus was only 1.8 percent of GDP in 2016, sharply down from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015.
U.S. President Donald Trump this week said in an interview that China hasn't been manipulating its currency for months, a sharp reversal from his campaign rhetoric.
Many economists have argued that the Chinese currency, RMB, has been at equilibrium level in recent years.
Over the last decade, China's effective exchange rate has appreciated more than any other major currency, rising a total of more than 40 percent, said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Brad Setser, an expert with Council on Foreign Relations, noted that the RMB exchange rate is now close to equilibrium. He expected that the RMB exchange rate would remain stable at current level with China's current account surplus and its efforts to deal with capital outflows.
The International Monetary Fund declared the RMB as no longer undervalued in 2015. Under Obama administration, the Treasury Department also dropped its previous assessment that the RMB was "significant undervalued".

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's banks extended 4.22 trillion yuan (613 billion U.S. dollars) in new yuan loans in the first quarter of 2017, down from 4.61 trillion yuan last year, central bank data showed Friday.
At the end of last month, total outstanding yuan-denominated loans stood at 110.83 trillion yuan, up 12.4 percent compared with the previous year.
A slowdown in credit expansion means that the economy is levering up at a slower pace, according to Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg.
Total social finance, a measurement of funds that non-financial firms and households get from the financial system, stood at 162.82 trillion yuan at the end of March, up 12.5 percent year on year, according to the PBOC data.
"The year-on-year growth of social finance in the first quarter suggests that support for the real economy has not eased off," said Ruan Jianhong, head of the Survey and Statistics Department at the central bank.
A breakdown of loan data also showed milder growth in mortgage lending, with outstanding real estate loans rising 26.1 percent year on year, down 0.9 percentage points compared with the overall growth in 2016.
The new data implies that government measures to address property speculation have begun to take effect, said Dong Ximiao with the Renmin University of China.
M1, a narrow measure of money supply which covers cash in circulation plus demand deposits, rose 18.8 percent from a year earlier to 48.88 trillion yuan. M2, a broad measure of money supply that covers cash in circulation and all deposits, grew 10.6 percent to about 160 trillion yuan, according to a People's Bank of China online statement.
M0, the amount of cash in circulation, was up 6.1 percent to 6.86 trillion yuan.
China's M2 target this year is growth of around 12 percent, one percentage point lower than the 2016 target.
"The smooth deceleration of M2 growth signals the implementation of the 'prudent and neutral' monetary policy and strengthened government supervision over the mounting leverage among financial institutions," said Ruan.
Ruan said M2 growth in the first quarter is in line with overall economic development.
Official data also indicated yuan-denominated deposits grew by 5.06 trillion yuan in the first quarter, with outstanding deposits at 156trillion yuan.

GUANGZHOU, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Half of the buyers at the upcoming Canton Fair will come from countries along the Belt and Road thanks to intensified promotion efforts, said organizers on Friday.
Purchasers from the countries along the ancient Silk Road routes have seen remarkable growth in recent years and they accounted for 44 percent of the total in the previous session, said Xu Bing, spokesperson for the 121st China Import and Export Fair, known as the Canton Fair.
The session is scheduled to take place in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, from Sunday through May 5, in three phases. Its exhibition area measures 1.18 million square meters, featuring more than 60,000 booths and nearly 25,000 domestic and foreign companies.
To boost trade cooperation, organizers upped promotion this year through direct invitations and social media, said Xu.
The import exhibition zone has attracted 364 companies from countries along the Belt and Road, or 58.7 percent of those present in the section.
The China Import and Export Fair is held every spring and autumn and is seen as a barometer of the country's foreign trade.

The year-on-year growth decelerated, though, from 4.61 trillion yuan loans added in the same period last year, according to the data.
By the end of last month, total outstanding yuan-denominated loans stood at 110.83 trillion yuan, up 12.4 percent compared with the previous year.
The M2, a broad measure of the money supply that covers cash in circulation and all deposits, grew 10.6 percent from a year earlier to about 159.96 trillion yuan by the end of March, according to an online People's Bank of China statement.
The M1, a narrow measure of the money supply which covers cash in circulation plus demand deposits, rose 18.8 percent year on year to 48.88 trillion yuan by the end of last month.
M0, the amount of cash in circulation, was up 6.1 percent to 6.86 trillion yuan.
China's monetary policy in 2017 is set to be "prudent and neutral," targeting M2 money supply to grow by around 12 percent, one percentage point lower than the 2016 target, to keep liquidity at appropriate levels.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The central bank's yuan outstanding for foreign exchange continued to drop in March, representing the 17th straight month of decline.
The funds declined 54.7 billion yuan (around 8 billion U.S. dollars) in March from February to 21.6 trillion yuan, data from the People's Bank of China showed Friday.
The decrease was less than the 58.1 billion yuan registered in February.
As the Chinese currency is not freely convertible under the capital account, the central bank has to purchase foreign currency generated by China's trade surplus and foreign investment in the country, adding funds to the money market.
China's forex reserves climbed to 3.009 trillion dollars by the end of March from 3.005 trillion dollars a month earlier, still the largest foreign exchange reserve stockpile in the world.

China central bank continues cash injections for second straight day

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank continued its net cash injections via open market operations Friday, the second straight day after a 13-day halt.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) conducted 90 billion yuan (about 13.1 billion U.S. dollars) of reverse repos, a process by which the central bank purchases securities from banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
The injection saw a net 70 billion yuan pumped into the financial system, offset by 20 billion yuan in maturing reverse repos.
The operations included 60 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repo prices to yield 2.45 percent, 20 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent, and 10 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
The move followed a central bank liquidity injection Thursday, which included 83.9 billion yuan through pledged supplementary lending and 110 billion yuan through reverse repos.
The restarting of such operations came after 40 billion yuan of reverse repos and 217 billion yuan from the medium-term lending facility matured Thursday, adding liquidity strain in the market.
The central bank has steered clear of interest rate cuts and avoided tinkering with reserve requirement ratios over the past year. An expanded range of tools, such as reverse repos and lending facilities, are managing liquidity and supporting growth.
China's monetary policy in 2017 is set to be "prudent and neutral," keeping appropriate liquidity levels and avoiding large injections.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stocks fell Friday, following declines on other Asian markets, with investors nervous about growing geopolitical uncertainty on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.91 percent at 3,246.07 points. The Shenzhen Component Index dropped 1.26 percent at 10,519.86 points.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board, lost 1.2 percent to close at 1,887.46 points.
Most shares went lower with losers outnumbering gainers by 973 to 163 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and 1,451 to 306 on the Shenzhen bourse.
Tension is increasing between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States over Washington's threat to stage military strikes against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests.
Asian markets pulled back amid geopolitical uncertainty, with the Nikkei Stock Average falling 0.49 percent to 18,335.63 and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index down 0.64 percent to settle at 2,134.88.
However, the uncertainty fueled gold and lifted stocks of Chinese gold miners. Stocks of Zhongjin Gold gained 2.81 percent to 13.16 yuan (1.91 U.S. dollars). Western Region Gold surged 4.16 percent to 26.32 yuan.

SHANGHAI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) has plans to issue bonds twice this year, one denominated in Chinese yuan and the other in Indian rupee, president of the bank K.V. Kamath said Friday.
The bank sold its first 3 billion yuan (437 million U.S. dollars) yuan-denominated bonds in China last year in July to fund clean energy projects in member states.
Kamath told Xinhua that following last year's issuance, the preparation for second batch of yuan-denominated bonds, possibly in the second half of this year, is expected to be more smooth. The size will be around 3 billion yuan, similar to the last one.
He said the issuance will come after the bank is rated by international rating agencies.
Between 300 million and 500 million U.S. dollars of rupee-denominated masala bonds will be issued after July, Kamath added. Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued outside India.
Kamath said the NDB plans to lend 2.5-3 billion dollars to fund 15 projects in member states this year, up from 1.5 billion dollars for seven projects in 2016. Most projects last year were connected to clean energy and transportation.
Kamath said the loans will go to more sectors this year. In India for example, the bank will prioritize rural drinking water networks and infrastructure projects.
The BRICS bank was set up with an initial authorized capital of 100 billion dollars after leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa signed the treaty for its establishment during the sixth BRICS Summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2014. It officially opened in Shanghai in 2015.

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's courier sector posted steady growth in the first quarter this year thanks to continued efforts to boost consumption and services, according to the State Post Bureau (SPB).
The sector generated 98.46 billion yuan (about 14.3 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue in the first three months of 2017, up 27.4 percent year on year, the bureau said.
A total of 7.59 billion deliveries were made during the same period, up 31.5 percent year on year, the bureau said.
According to the SPB data, 3.03 billion parcels were delivered in March, up 28.1 percent year on year.
For the month of March the revenue of courier businesses reached 38.26 billion yuan, up 25.4 percent year on year, said the SPB.
The country plans to extend the courier network and improve computerized systems, services and international connections by 2020.

China's fiscal revenue maintains fast growth

BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- China's fiscal revenue has maintained fast growth since the start of the year on the back of surging prices and a firming economy, official data showed Friday.
Fiscal revenue rose 14.1 percent year on year to 4.44 trillion yuan (645.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, the Ministry of Finance disclosed at a press conference.
The growth slightly retreated from the 14.9-percent gain seen in the January-February period, but was still markedly above the 4.5-percent rate in 2016.
In March alone, fiscal revenue went up 12.2 percent to 1.29 trillion yuan.
The ministry attributed the continued momentum to rising prices at the factory gate, a firming economy, and recovering exports and imports.
China's producer price index, which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, has stayed in positive territory since September last year, when it ended a four-year streak of declines, partly due to the government's successful campaign to cut industrial overcapacity.
The index stayed at an elevated level last month, rising 7.6 percent year on year.
The upward trend in turn boosted industrial profits and economic activities, which helped drive growth in tax revenues, according to the ministry.
Friday's data showed taxes collected from the corporate sector went up 18.8 percent due to increasing profits, while taxes from goods imports surged 41.9 percent.
The central government collected 2.02 trillion yuan in fiscal revenue, up 17.1 percent year on year, while local governments saw fiscal revenue expand 11.7 percent to 2.42 trillion yuan.
In the first three months, fiscal spending surged 21 percent year on year to 4.59 trillion yuan, among which expenditure on affordable housing jumped 46.8 percent to 135.3 billion yuan.
This year China's fiscal deficit is projected to be 3 percent of GDP, or 2.38 trillion yuan, according to the government work report last month.

Foreigners in Shanghai FTZ have easier access to China "green cards"

Editor: yan
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The latest benefit of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ) is to its non-Chinese residents, who can apply for permanent residence in China simply with a letter of recommendation from the FTZ authorities.
According to the social security bureau of Shanghai Pudong New Area, the new policy will take effect in mid-April, and apply to both the applicants and their spouses and minor children.
The move was made following 10 rules related to China's entry and exit policy announced by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which authorize Shanghai Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone and Shanghai FTZ to recommend high-level foreign staff for permanent residence permits, Chinese "green cards".
Those with permanent residence will enjoy the same rights as Chinese citizens in areas such as investment, housing purchases and schooling.
The reform is to support Shanghai's ambition of becoming a world sci-tech innovation hub.
Those who qualify for the fast track application include well-known award winners or high-level talent scheme finalists, such as Nobel laureates, the Chinese government "Friendship Award" and other world-class, national and municipal awards; people in charge of Shanghai FTZ-based national laboratories, engineering laboratories, foreign investment R&D institutions, and top-level talent from innovation and start-up enterprises.
A Chinese green card is one of the hardest to obtain with no more than 7,000 issued since 2004, when the policy was introduced. That compares with about 600,000 foreigners currently living in China, and the application procedure is rather complicated.
In 2016, 1,576 foreigners became permanent Chinese residents, an increase of 163 percent on the previous year, according the MPS.
China has made huge progress in easing its residence and entry policies for foreigners since September 2015, which has helped attract more talent from overseas as well as boosting international exchanges and the economy, according to a ministry statement.
Shanghai saw six times more permanent residence applications from foreigners and their families in 2016 from 2015. The number of such applications in Beijing last year increased 426 percent.

NICOSIA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese investors have contributed to a large extent to the revival of the construction sector in Cyprus following its collapse after the 2013 economic crisis, an expert in the property market said on Thursday.

He said that the Paphos area in western Cyprus attracted mostly Chinese buyers as property developers from this region were the first to visit China to attract customers after the Cyprus's 10-billion-euro bailout in March 2013.
"As early as 2013, Chinese people started buying property in Paphos, " he said.
Data showed that contracts for property transactions submitted to the land registry department reached 7,063, an increase of 43 percent in 2016 for the eastern Mediterranean island.
"Not all regions benefited by the same ratio. Land development in Limassol went up by 59 percent, and by 40 percent in Paphos. Demand came mostly from foreign purchasers and especially in Paphos from Chinese buyers," Talatinis said.
Land registry department data showed that in 2016 there had been 295 completed purchases by foreigners in Paphos out of a total of 958 for the whole of Cyprus and another 627 sale agreements in which the buyers are non-Cypriots had been filed with the land registry department, out of a total of 1,183.
Filing a sale contract with the land registry department is a guarantee for the purchaser that the same property cannot be legally sold more than once.
Talatinis said that for the size of Cyprus and its economy, even one-half of these would have made an impact.
But home buying is still far behind its 2008 peak, the year Cyprus joined the eurozone, when a total of 16,000 contracts were filed with the land registry department.
Talatinis said prices are still down to between 70 and 75 percent relative to 2008 but there is a fluctuation between regions. Prices for sea-side properties in Limassol and Paphos are close of even above those of 2008 due to foreign demand, but in other areas are still depressed.
The Federation of Associations of Building Contractors Cyprus said the increase in construction is continuing in 2017.
The association president, Costas Roushas, said data showed that building activity increased by 23 percent in the first two months this year relative to the same period in 2016, on top of an increase of 21 percent for the whole of last year.
Roushas said a factor which helped the construction of new houses was a cut of 50 percent in transfer fees introduced last year by the government.
He said that reducing value added tax on the purchase of houses to 5 percent from the current level of 19 percent could boost even more the construction sector.
Roushas said that a considerable part of the activity is due to the construction of high-rise luxury buildings in Limassol offering luxury apartment and office space.
At least three complexes up to 30 floors high are under construction along the sea-front of the city. (1 euro = 1.06 U.S. dollars)

China Focus: Chinese economy rebalances amid resilient regional growth

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China must manage the interplay between near-term growth and long-term economic rebalancing, as uncertainty in major developed economies weighs on the broadly positive outlook for developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific.
BALANCING ACT
"China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth continues," the World Bank said Thursday in a report titled "East Asia and Pacific Economic Update."
The bank expects the Chinese economy to slow gradually as it rebalances toward consumption and services and forecast growth of 6.5 percent in 2017 and 6.3 percent in 2018, compared with 6.7 percent in 2016.
"In China, growth will continue to moderate, reflecting the impact of the government's measures to reduce excess capacity and credit expansion," said the report, adding that the real estate sector is expected to slow.
Since October, dozens of cities have announced measures to prevent home prices from rising out of control.
China should continue to give priority to reducing excess capacity, curbing the credit surge, lowering debt leverage in the corporate sector and reforming state-owned enterprises, Sudhir Shetty, chief economist of the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region, said in a video conference at the launch of the report.
China has begun to tackle those issues and should show results in the medium term, Shetty told reporters.
"Chinese policymakers will manage the balancing act," which means that they will continue with long-term structural reforms, support new growth engines of the economy, and facilitate the economy transitioning towards services and high value-added products, Shetty said.
REFORM OPPORTUNITY
Growth in the first quarter may prove stronger than the bank's prediction for the year and provide opportunities to advance structural reform, contain credit expansion and improve efficiency, said John Litwack, World Bank lead economist for China.
Adding to recent positive signs, Thursday's data showed foreign trade growing well in the first quarter, a pickup in external demand and a firming domestic economy, giving policymakers with more room to maneuver.
The strong start to the year has helped ease worries that growth may slow too sharply, preventing authorities from meeting their target of creating over 11 million jobs this year, 1 million more than last year's target.
The World Bank also recommended tighter regulation of shadow banking, addressing rising household mortgages, and complementing reduced industrial capacity with better social and labor policies.
GLOBAL RISKS
Despite broadly positive prospects for the next three years in the East Asian and Pacific region, the World Bank highlighted problems that may exacerbate the vulnerability of some economies.
Facing interest rate increases in the United States, protectionism, credit expansion and high levels of debt in several East Asian countries, the bank recommended prudent macroeconomic management to ensure sustainable fiscal balances in the medium term.
As a whole, developing economies in East Asia and Pacific are expected to expand at 6.2 percent in 2017 and 6.1 percent in 2018, driven by domestic demand, and recovery of the global economy and commodity prices.
However, for growth to be sustained, countries in the region will need to "reduce fiscal vulnerabilities while improving the quality of public spending and fostering global and regional integration," said Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank Vice President for East Asia and Pacific.

China remains as world's largest goods exporter: WTO

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China maintained its position as the World's largest goods exporter in 2016, a Ministry of Commerce statement said Thursday, citing data from the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Accounting for 13.2 percent of the world's total in value, China's goods exports topped 2.1 trillion U.S. dollars last year, in contrast to 1.6 trillion dollars in imports, the statement said.
This is the eighth consecutive year China has kept its position as the world's largest goods exporter and the second largest importer.
World goods exports declined 3.3 percent year on year in 2016 to 15.5 trillion dollars, it said.
In 2017, global trade is likely to grow by 2.4 percent year on year despite uncertainties, according to the WTO.
China's exports and imports have leapfrogged in decades of reforms and opening-up, especially after China's entry into the WTO in 2001.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Guarding against financial contagion will be high on the central bank's agenda this year, a senior official said Thursday.
It will be challenging to maintain financial stability this year due to global financial uncertainties, mixed risks from foreign markets and rising illegal financial activities, Fan Yifei, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), pointed out at a meeting.
The central bank will enhance investigation to guard against financial risks and improve policy tools to maintain financial stability, such as using the deposit insurance system to deal with financial risks, according to Fan.
The PBOC will continue opening up the financial sector and engage further in global financial governance, he added.
China's financial markets regulators have been improving the supervision and punishment of financial irregularities this year to protect against systemic financial crisis, a key task outlined by the country's top leadership.

Uber resumes operations in Taiwan with new business model

TAIPEI, April 13 (Xinhua) - After suspending business on the island for two months, Uber announced their return to the Taiwan market Thursday, after several rounds of negotiations with regulators.
Taiwan insisted that the company could only operate as a "technology platform" rather than as a transportation company because it registered as such when it entered Taiwan in 2013.
"Uber will partner with local car rental companies and mainly work as an online booking platform on the island," said Ku Li-kai, Uber's general manager in Taiwan.
Only licensed commercial drivers registered with local rental car companies can accept orders on Uber. Users place orders on Uber and select rides based on driver information and price. Uber does not provide price comparison but only shows one price from one company at a time. If the passenger does not like the price offered, another request must be made.
Though authorized to resume operations, Uber still faces huge fines amounting to over 830 million new taiwan dollars (27 million U.S. dollars) for unlicensed ride-sharing services.
In February alone, Taiwan's transport authority issued 22 fines to Uber amounting to over 230 million new Taiwan dollars, and ordered the company to suspend services. The company later announced it would quit Taiwan.
Ku said Uber would continue to work with authorities to settle the issue.

Profits of China's central SOEs surge in Q1

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The combined net profits of China's centrally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) soared 26.5 percent in the first quarter to 226.42 billion yuan (33 billion U.S. dollars), the state assets regulator said Thursday.
Among 102 central SOEs, 99 saw profits in the first three months, with 81 companies collecting more profits than a year ago. Forty-three saw profit increases of more than 10 percent, according to a report from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
Strong profits were reported among traditional sectors such as oil, steel, non-ferrous metals and coal, as well as new sectors, including advanced manufacturing, medicine and modern service sectors.
"Central SOEs are off to a good start, signaling that the economy is stabilizing and market demand is gradually improving," Shen Ying, chief accountant of SASAC, said at a press conference.
Looking forward, many favorable factors will sustain the strong performance of central SOEs, such as rising producer prices, recovering demand and stronger corporate confidence, Shen said.
China's producer price index, which measures the cost of goods at the factory gate, rose year on year for a seventh month in March, and is likely to continue the steady growth, she said.
China's manufacturing sector stayed above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row last month. "The business confidence of most central SOEs strengthened," Shen added.
However, facing both domestic and external uncertainties, central SOEs may see their profit growth slow somewhat later this year, according to Shen.
Their total revenue rose 19.2 percent to 6 trillion yuan, 4 percentage points higher than growth in the first two months.
Central SOEs paid about 530 billion yuan in taxes and fees, up 7.5 percent from a year earlier, the report showed.
Meanwhile, central SOEs in telecommunications, electricity and oil sectors lowered the prices of their products to help cut overall costs.

Economic Watch: China's Q1 trade buoyant, surplus shrinks

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by a pickup in external demand and a stable domestic economy, China's foreign trade retained robust growth in the first quarter with a shrinking surplus, customs data showed Thursday.
Imports grew faster than exports in the three months with surging import prices, resulting in a 35.7-percent shrinking of the trade surplus, data from the General Administration of Customs (GAC) showed.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, while imports increased 31.1 percent.
Foreign trade volume reached 6.2 trillion yuan (about 902.47 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, up 21.8 percent year on year, with a surplus of 454.94 billion yuan.
Surging import prices and a stable domestic economy boosted the figures, GAC spokesman Huang Songping told a press briefing on Thursday.
"The foreign trade situation in China is still complex with many instabilities and uncertainties, and the difficulties that China faces are not short-term ones," Huang said, adding that foreign trade expansion is likely to fall back in the second quarter.
During the first three months, trade with the European Union gained 16.9 percent year on year, while that with the United States and ASEAN increased 21.3 percent and 25 percent, respectively, together accounting for 41.4 percent of foreign trade.
Trade with some countries along the Belt and Road has registered growth. In the first quarter, China's trade with Russia, Pakistan, Poland, Kazakhstan and India rose by 37 percent, 18.7 percent, 19 percent, 69.3 percent and 27.7 percent respectively.
A weaker yuan, stronger global demand, and diminished threat of U.S. tariffs contributed to China's strong exports in Q1, said Bloomberg chief Asia economist Tom Orlik.
A marked contraction in China's trade surplus with the world should take the edge off complaints from trade partners, he said.
The Q1 export growth hit a two-year high largely backed by economic recovery in the United States, the European Union and Japan, said Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities, who also cited a relatively weak yuan in fueling the growth.
Meanwhile, strong momentum of domestic industrial enterprises along with a remarkably warmer real economy contributed to the surge in imports, he said.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.8 in March, staying in expansion territory for an eighth consecutive month.
The reading beat market expectations and was the highest in nearly five years. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a barometer of international trade, rose to 1,141 points last month from 759 points in February, according to Ren Zeping, chief economist at Founder Securities. An increase in BDI means growing global demand for raw materials and more need for shipping services.
Import figures in 2017 will be better than last year as domestic demand continues to recover, while an all-out trade war between China and the United States has become unlikely, further boosting the outlook of foreign trade, he said.
The biggest risk remains U.S. trade policy, but the chance of sweeping trade sanctions has come down, said Orlik in a research note.
A 100-day review of the bilateral trade relationship -- announced by the White House -- will likely result in some increase in trade measures, he added.
Customs data also reflected the improved structure of trade. In the first quarter, the volume of general trade grew 23.2 percent to 3.49 trillion yuan, taking up 56.2 percent of the total volume of foreign trade, 0.6 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
Private enterprises took a larger share of foreign trade. Trade of private enterprises grew 22.5 percent to 2.28 trillion yuan, accounting for 36.8 percent of the country's total foreign trade volume, 0.2 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
In a breakdown of products, electro-mechanical products and traditional labor-intensive products remained the major export goods.
Meanwhile, imports of primary commodities such as iron ore and crude oil continued to grow in both volume and price.

LOS ANGELES, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro) on Wednesday signed a 647 million-U.S.-dollar contract to purchase 282 rail cars from a Chinese company.
Under the contract, LA Metro will firstly pay 178 million dollars for 64 rail cars built by China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) to upgrade the U.S. county's subway system.
Of the first batch of HR 4000 rail cars to be delivered by September 2021, 30 will replace the 25-year-oldspider Red and Purple Line trains and 34 will serve the Purple Line Extension that is expected to open in 2023.
"We anticipate there will be 50,000 weekday boardings once all seven new stations are built, and there will be nearly 80,000 new daily trips on this entire Metro rail system as a result of the opening of the Purple Line Extension," LA Metro CEO Phillip A. Washington said at a signing ceremony.
"We are going to need these trains to meet our future ridership demand," he added.
A new facility will also be purchased in the LA region to manufacture major components for propulsion, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting systems.
Therefore, the contract will create about 50 jobs generating up to 38 million dollars in local wages and benefits. About 10 percent of all the new jobs will be created for disadvantaged workers and workers from lower social economic communities.
"We work with the local companies, local government and local educational institutions to create a win-win situation," CRRC President Xi Guohua told Xinhua.
"We will create job opportunities, increase tax revenue and stimulate the local economy through our partnership and collaborations," he said.
As required by LA Metro, the new trains will run up to 120 kph and can be in service for 40 years.
Compared with the existing trains, the new cars also come with improvements for passengers' experience, including active line maps, LED displays and special designs between the train sets which will allow people to move more freely from one car to another.
Washington said LA Metro, which transports about 1.3 million passengers per day, is making the county an "infrastructure capital of the world."
"CRRC is now a partner in that endeavor," he said.



China Focus: China's economy off to good start in Q1

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's economy was off to a good start in the first quarter of this year with recovering economic vitality and market expectations, the top economic planner said Thursday.
STRONG OPTIMISM
"Following a positive trend in the second half of last year, the Chinese economy maintained stable yet progressive momentum," said Yan Pengcheng, spokesperson with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), citing latest indicators.
China's electricity use, an important indicator of economic activity, rose 6.9 percent in the first quarter of the year to 1.45 trillion kilowatt hours, he revealed at a press conference.
Yan especially noted that high-tech industries saw rapid rises in power use, with information transmission, computer services and software sectors recording 13.3 percent growth in energy consumption.
Meanwhile, China's railway freight volume climbed 15.3 percent in the first three months, and the manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 51.8 in March, staying above 51 for a sixth consecutive month, according to Yan.
The country's economic growth for the first quarter is scheduled to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) next Monday, which is largely expected to be around 6.8 percent.
The government trimmed its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest in a quarter of a century.
REMAINING INSTABILITY
Despite optimism on first-quarter growth, Yan said the stability and sustainability of the momentum remains to be observed, as China's economic development is still restrained by a few external and internal factors and the issue of structural imbalance.
He drew particular attention to the influence of commodity prices in the international market on China's domestic prices.
China's consumer inflation grew mildly in the first quarter on the back of a firming economy, fresh NBS data showed. But the producer price index (PPI), measuring cost of goods at the factory gate, jumped 7.4 percent year on year.
Yan said the strong PPI growth was mostly driven by the carry-over effect of last year's price changes and a rise in factory-gate prices in several industries such as coal and steel-making.
He expected PPI growth to peak in the first quarter as China's aggregate demand will level off in the following quarters, given China's stable economic performance.
But future changes in commodity prices in the international market will add uncertainty to the domestic PPI trend, he said, citing recent oil price upswings due to conflicts in the Middle East.
PLANNING FOR XIONGAN NEW AREA
Yan said the NDRC will next push the drafting of detailed plans for building the Xiongan New Area, which was brought into the public spotlight after the government announced it will create a brand new economic zone earlier this month.
The blueprint will highlight both "international standards" and "Chinese characteristics," drawing talent from home and abroad and international experience to build the area, he said.
On April 1, China announced plans to create Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone about 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing. The new area spans the counties of Xiongxian, Rongcheng and Anxin in Hebei, and is home to Baiyangdian, a major wetland in northern China.
The new area will initially cover around 100 square km and expand to 2,000 square km in the long term.
Besides plans for the 100-square-km initial zone and the overall development of the Xiongan New Area, a specific plan for pollution control and environmental protection of Baiyangdian will be drafted as part of the blueprint, according to Yan.
The top economic planner promised to provide policy and funding support for the new area's major projects in transportation, ecology, water conservation, energy and public services.
Nationwide, the NDRC has approved 56 fixed-asset investment projects with total investment reaching 240.9 billion yuan (about 35.04 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, mainly covering water conservation, energy and transportation sectors.

China's land supply measures to have mixed effect on developers: report

Editor: Yamei
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's latest land supply measures will have mixed implications for property developers, according to a Moody's report.
The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and Ministry of Land and Resources announced measures that cities with less than a year's supply of housing inventory should increase the amount of residential land for sale, and cities with more than three year's supply should suspend residential land sales.
The ministries also said that cities and counties with more
than 1 million inhabitants should formulate three-year (2017-2019) and
five-year (2017-2021) plans for the supply of housing land and make
plans public by the end of June.
"We believe that housing price growth will slow in cities where land
supply will increase, a credit negative for developers that purchased
land at high prices during the past 12 months with the expectation that
housing prices will continue to surge," said Chris Wong, a Moody's analyst,in a report.
Wong said this slowdown would pressure gross margins for those developers, while developers operating in cities with large housing inventories -- mainly lower-tier cities -- would benefit as the measures would restrict new supply in those cities.
This situation will give developers a better idea of land supply and
should help them manage their expectations on land availability and
prices, and subsequently help them manage their land acquisition plans, said the report.
The report said that it remained to be seen if the new measures would materially increase land supply within the next six to 12 months in high-tier cities that have less than six months of inventory, given the limited supply of land suitable for development and the relatively long time frame for redeveloping shantytowns.
The move is among a slew of measures the Chinese government has implemented since late September 2016 to cool fast growth in housing prices, including restrictions on home purchases and increased minimum down-payment requirements.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China is continuing its economic rebalancing while the outlook for developing East Asian and Pacific economies is expected to remain broadly positive over the next three years, the World Bank said Thursday.
The regional economic momentum was driven by robust domestic demand and a gradual recovery in the global economy and commodity prices, the World Bank said in a report titled "East Asia and Pacific Economic Update."
"China's transition to slower but structurally rebalanced growth continues," noted the report released Thursday.
It expected the Chinese economy to continue to slow gradually as it rebalances toward consumption and services. It has forecast China's economic growth rate to reach 6.5 percent in 2017 and 6.3 percent in 2018, compared with 6.7 percent in 2016.
"In China, growth will continue to moderate, reflecting the impact of the government's measures to reduce excess capacity and credit expansion," said the report, adding that activity in the real estate sector is expected to slow down.
In the rest of the region, including large economies in Southeast Asia, growth is expected to pick up slightly to 5 percent in 2017 and 5.1 percent in 2018, up from 4.9 percent in 2016, it said.
As a whole, the economies of developing East Asia and Pacific are projected to expand at 6.2 percent in 2017 and 6.1 percent in 2018, noted the report.

Starbucks ups employee benefits amid ambitious China expansion plan

Editor: Xiang Bo
SHANGHAI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Starbucks will provide an insurance plan to help thousands of its employees in China care for their aging parents, as the global coffee chain sticks to its ambitious expansion plan in the traditionally tea-drinking country.
Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz made the announcement during his China visit this week.
According to the company, full-time employees on the Chinese mainland with parents under the age of 75 years can apply for the China Parent Care Program, which covers medical treatment for 30 common critical illnesses among the elderly in China. More than 10,000 parents are expected to benefit, it said.
In an interview with Xinhua, Schultz said the decision was made after the company discovered the Chinese have unique and powerful family responsibilities to their parents.
Schultz said the commitment was so real and powerful that a survey found 70 to 80 percent of the company's Chinese employees think taking care of their parents is the most desirable benefit they could receive.
"When I sat down (with the employees) and said, 'Tell me what is your dream for yourself,' the only thing that kept coming was not about themselves but 'to take care of my parents,'" Schultz said.
"It is a very easy decision for us....but I view it as a significant opportunity to say thank you to our people and to reassure them of fulfilling their commitment," he said.
The Seattle-based coffee chain entered the Chinese market 18 years ago. But it was not until very recently that its coffee business made leaps and bounds.
In 2011, there were only around 400 Starbucks in China, but today the number has soared to 2,600. And the coffee chain's footprint has gone beyond major metropolises to 127 cities. About 40,000 people were employed.
China has become Starbucks's largest overseas and fastest-growing market.
Schultz confirmed an expansion plan announced last year under which Starbucks China aims to double its number of stores to 5,000 by 2021 and add 10,000 new jobs every year in the next five years.
"We are going to play a 'long game' and we are investing heavily to build a big and enduring business," he said, adding that he is optimistic about the Chinese economy and consumers.
He said people have come to accept that coffee is a beverage that brings people together, which feeds people's longing for human connection just as well as Chinese tea has.
Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong credited the company's success in China to the country's rapidly expanding middle class, a rising coffee market, and the growth of ritual coffee-drinking behavior.
Schultz said Starbucks will open its first international roastery and reserve tasting room at the end of this year in Shanghai.
Its first roastery opened in Seattle about two years ago to display premium coffee beans and demonstrate unique brewing techniques. Schultz said the Shanghai roastery will be twice the size of the one in Seattle and he cannot wait for it to open.
Starbucks will also continue digital innovation to appeal to China's millennials, Schultz said. The company has recently partnered with Wechat to enable mobile phone payment and started to offer gifting on the popular Chinese social media platform.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares gained on Thursday as better-than-expected trade data and a central bank liquidity injection boosted market sentiment.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.07 percent at 3,275.96 points, and the smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.63 percent higher at 10,654.08 points.
The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board, gained 0.68 percent to close at 1,910.48 points.
A number of shares related to the Xiongan New Area suspended trading on Thursday, after days of consecutive gains pushed their stock prices significantly higher.
Sectors including environmental protection, real estate and cement led the gains, while shares of financial service firms in Hebei Province also jumped in afternoon trading.
The gain came after a central bank liquidity injection Thursday, which included 83.9 billion yuan (12.2 billion U.S. dollars) through pledged supplementary lending and 110 billion yuan through reverse repos.
It was the first time that the central bank pumped money into the financial system through reverse repos since a 13-day halt.
Market sentiment was also boosted by better-than-expected trade data published Thursday. Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 22.3 percent year on year in March, beating market estimates of 8 percent, while imports increased 26.3 percent, also surpassing expectation, Customs data showed.
"The unexpected jump in imports was in line with recovery of the domestic economy, while rising overseas demand boosted exports," said Deng Haiqing, chief economist with JZ Securities.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top economic planner said Thursday that it had approved 56 fixed-asset investment projects with total investment reaching 240.9 billion yuan (about 35.04 billion U.S. dollars) in the first three months of this year.
"The projects mainly covered water conservation, energy and transportation sectors," said Yan Pengcheng, spokesperson with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
Water conservation projects took the largest share of the investment, with 99.8 billion yuan going to nine projects, including a flood control project on the Chaohu Lake, the country's fifth largest fresh water lake.
"The NDRC has put more focus on fields such as poverty reduction, agriculture, water conservation and innovation to improve the foundation of sustained economic development," Yan said.
China's fixed-asset investment grew 8.9 percent year on year to 4.1378 trillion yuan in the first two months the year, up from 8.1 percent in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's electricity use rose significantly in the first quarter of the year, signalling a pick-up in economic activities, the country's top economic planner said Thursday.
"Power consumption rose 6.9 percent year on year in the first three quarters of this year, 3.7 percentage points higher than the same period last year," said Yan Pengcheng, spokesperson of the National Development and Reform Commission.
In March alone, power use rose 7.9 percent year on year to 513.9 billion kilowatt hours, 2.3 percentage points higher than the level a year ago, Yan told a press conference.
Electricity use in the primary industry climbed by 10.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, while power consumption in the secondary industry went up 7.6 percent.
The tertiary industry and residential power consumption saw slower growth in the quarter, rising 7.8 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, he said.
Power use growth in the tertiary industry was 3.2 percentage points lower than the level of first quarter 2016, though high-tech industries saw rapid rises, with information transmission, computer services and software sectors recording 13.3 percent growth in energy consumption, according to Yan.
"China's economic development is off to a good start in the first quarter of this year with market expectations improving and the employment situation steady," he said.

Argentina revamps rail transport with China's help

Editor: Tian Shaohui
LLAVALLOL, Argentina, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Argentina has embarked on an ambitious plan to upgrade its dilapidated rail transport, taking China as a key partner providing both technology and manpower.
Xinhua toured workshops serving the network's central Roca Line, in Llavallol, a town located 33 km south of the capital Buenos Aires, where technicians from China's CRRC Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co., Ltd. are working side by side with their Argentinian counterparts on the binational undertaking.
The technicians arrive daily by special transport to carry out maintenance work on trains that the Argentine government has purchased to completely revamp the network's Roca, Sarmiento and Mitre lines.
The China-made trains are quieter than their precursors, some of which date from the 1970s, and are more energy efficient, even though passenger cars are air conditioned.
The modern cars also have special features for commuters with disabilities, and are installed with security cameras and a safety system that prevents the train from moving while doors are open.
Yang Haijun, who has worked in Argentina for the past three years as a CRRC administrator and head technician, said he took an instant liking to the locals.
"With just a 'hello,' I sensed their friendship and enthusiasm," Yang told Xinhua.
They are also quick to learn, he said.
"Argentinians are very studious. At the beginning, we offered the country technological and operational services as the Argentinians did not know how to handle the trains well. But after receiving our training, which lasted for two years, they have mastered the technology," said Yang.
Fabian Malvillini, general coordinator of Engineering Management at the state-run rail operator SOFSE, the agency responsible for running and maintaining the lines, has 30 years of experience in rail transit.
The upgrade has been notable, he said, especially in terms of bolstering safety features.
"For us, it means a very significant technological change, mainly in terms of security. It is a very good product and we are very pleased to be able to work with the engineering staff (from China), who are very good people and very professional," said Malvillini.
The modernization of the rail is also making maintenance work easier, he said.
"The technological changes have really simplified maintenance, because the systems, such as traction and alternate currents, require maintenance that is much faster and simpler," said Malvillini.
On the other hand, the trains' high-tech aspects are proving more challenging.
"In contrast, we do have to train a lot in computing. Many of the systems are computerized, so we have to train people, and they (the Chinese technicians) help us with that," Malvillini said.
"Personally, I have learned a lot from the traction system, which is different, new and novel in the metropolitan network, and the knowledge they transmit to us on a day to day basis," he added.
The Roca Line is the most heavily used within the metropolitan rail network, which serves the capital and surrounding communities.
Figures from the national transport commission (CNRT) show 329.5 million commuters used the system's seven lines in 2015, with Roca transporting 128.7 million.
The decision to modernize the system followed a tragic accident in February 2012 that left 51 passengers dead and another 789 injured, after a train on the Sarmiento Line failed to break as it entered the Once Station.
After the third worst rail accident in the country's history, then President Cristina Fernandez (2007-2015) decided to partner with China to improve the capital's transit system, a partnership that continues under her successor Mauricio Macri.
The two countries are also working together to modernize Argentina's cargo rail network.

BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's imports grew faster than exports in the first quarter, resulting in a 35.7-percent shrinking of trade surplus, customs data showed Thursday.
Exports in yuan-denominated terms rose 14.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, while imports increased 31.1 percent.
Foreign trade volume reached 6.2 trillion yuan (about 902.47 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, up 21.8 percent year on year, with a surplus of 454.94 billion yuan.
Customs data reflected an improved structure of trade modes. In the first quarter, the volume of general trade grew 23.2 percent to 3.49 trillion yuan, taking up 56.2 percent of the total volume of foreign trade, 0.6 percentage points higher than the same period of last year.
Trade with some countries along the "the Belt and Road" has registered growth. In the first quarter, China's trade with Russia, Pakistan, Poland, Kazakhstan and India rose by 37 percent, 18.7 percent, 19 percent, 69.3 percent and 27.7 percent respectively.
During the first three months, trade with the European Union gained 16.9 percent year on year. Trade with the United States and ASEAN increased 21.3 percent and 25 percent, respectively, together accounting for 41.4 percent of foreign trade.
Private enterprises took a larger share of foreign trade. Trade of private enterprises grew 22.5 percent to 2.28 trillion yuan, accounting for 36.8 percent of the country's total foreign trade volume, 0.2 percentage points higher than the same period last year.
In a breakdown of products, electro-mechanical products and traditional labor-intensive products remained the major export goods.
Meanwhile, imports of primary commodities such as iron ore and crude oil continued to grow in both volume and price.

China central bank resumes cash injections into money market

Editor: Tian Shaohui
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Thursday resumed cash injections into the financial system via pledged supplementary lending and reverse repos, after a 13-day halt.
The People's Bank of China pumped 83.9 billion yuan (12.2 billion U.S. dollars) through pledged supplementary lending and 110 billion yuan through reverse repos.
The operations included 70 billion yuan of 7-day reverse repo priced to yield 2.45 percent, 20 billion yuan of 14-day contracts with a yield of 2.6 percent, and 20 billion yuan of 28-day agreements with a yield of 2.75 percent.
The restarting of such operations came after 40 billion yuan of reverse repos and 217 billion yuan from the medium-term lending facility matured Thursday, adding liquidity strain in the market.
China's central bank is being pulled in many directions by competing objectives, but nimble use of diverse monetary tools is helping to ease tensions and meet the country's monetary goals.
Over the past year, the bank has steered clear of interest rate cuts and avoided tinkering with reserve requirement ratios. An expanded range of tools, such as reverse repos and lending facilities, are managing liquidity and supporting growth.
China's monetary policy in 2017 is set to be "prudent and neutral," keeping appropriate liquidity levels and avoiding large injections.

SINGAPORE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) announced Wednesday that it had established a branch in Singapore.
The Singapore branch is the first overseas branch of SPD Bank and will spearhead its internationalization strategy, especially in Southeast Asia, the bank said.
Speaking at the opening ceremony on Wednesday evening, Sim Ann, senior minister of the state of Singapore, said financial cooperation is a key pillar of the cooperation between Singapore and Shanghai and the opening of SPD Bank's Singapore branch is a milestone for the internationalization of the bank which brings vitality to Singapore's vibrant financial environment.
The minister said the establishment of SPD bank's Singapore branch will further promote trade and economic exchanges and strengthen the financial cooperation between the two sides.
She expressed the hope the multifaceted cooperation between Singapore and Shanghai will promote the Belt and Road Initiative.
In his speech, Vice Chairman and President of SPD Bank Singapore Liu Xinyi underscored Singapore's pivotal role in the Asia Pacific region and the global financial sector, saying the bank aims to improve its cross-border financial services capabilities via the branch.
"The bank plans to make Singapore Branch our key regional hub, acting as a conduit between our clients and Southeast Asia, and at the same time using the establishment of the Singapore Branch as the new launch-pad of our internationalization strategy," said Liu.
SPD Bank has accelerated its pace of internationalization and comprehensive development in recent years. The Singapore Branch obtained its banking license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore on March 21, according to the bank's press release.

Economic Watch: Smart tactics help China meet monetary objectives

Editor: Xiang Bo
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank is pulled in many directions by competing objectives, yet nimble use of diverse monetary tools is helping to ease tensions and meet the bank's goals.
Over the past year, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has steered clear of interest rate cuts and avoided tinkering with reserve requirement ratios (RRR). An expanded range of tools, such as reverse repos and lending facilities, are managing liquidity and supporting growth.
On Wednesday, the PBOC again skipped reverse repo auctions, refraining from adding cash to the banking system now for 13 days, the longest stretch since daily open market operations began at the beginning of last year.
Since March 24, the PBOC has drained 490 billion yuan (about 71 billion U.S. dollars) from the system, claiming that liquidity remains at a "relative high level" despite a slight decline.
Skipping reverse repo auctions reduces leverage in the system and eases asset bubbles, according to Wen Bin, a researcher with China Minsheng Bank.
The PBOC also has a duty to help stabilize prices, support the yuan and stay focused on growth in a restructuring economy that is expanding at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century.
Last year, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan promised a more "dynamic" way of managing the money supply to meet the demands of reform and development. The bank had lowered both benchmark interest rates and RRR five times in 2015, but made only one cut, to the RRR, early in 2016.
Lowering interest rates or RRR may stimulate growth, but runs the risks of fueling speculation about monetary easing, growing asset bubbles and putting the yuan under pressure.
This departure from traditional tools suggests growing attention to new financial risks, defusing them before they emerge and focusing on deleveraging. Leaving benchmark rates on hold, the central bank has been able to ensure liquidity, force more efficient use of capital and reduce leverage without choking off last year's promising rebound in the economy.
Wang Chuan of the National Academy of Economic Strategy wants the PBOC to expand its toolkit for short-term liquidity management and prioritize price stabilization and economic restructuring.
Continued improvements in the economy coupled with mild inflation give the central bank more room to maneuver. Data released Wednesday showed consumer inflation growth stayed low at 0.9 percent in March, while factory-gate prices rose at a slower pace, more evidence of steady economic growth and moderate inflation.
The PBOC will likely continue nudging market rates higher, but that is more about yuan weakness and deleveraging than inflation, according to Bloomberg chief Asia economist Tom Orlik.

CHANGSHA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's rolling-stock maker CRRC Corp. agreed a sale of 22 meter-gauge trains to Malaysia on Wednesday.
The contract between the CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive and the Malaysian Transport Ministry was signed in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, central China.
The order includes 13 four-car trains with supercapacitor energy storage. The supercapacitor shortens the time it takes to start the trains and reuses 85 percent of the energy generated in braking. The trains can run up to 100 km per hour.
The other nine, the world's fastest meter-gauge trains, can run at 160 km per hour.
Twenty of the trains will be made at a plant of the CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive in Malaysia. The first two trains will be delivered at the end of next year.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's leather exports dropped 11.3 percent year on year to 76.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 on weak demand, according to the China Leather Industry Association.
Exports to the United States, the largest overseas market, declined by 15 percent year on year, Ye Xiangju, deputy secretary general of the China Leather Industry Association, said at a press conference.
The decline was caused by higher raw material costs, lower demand and weaker comparative advantage of Chinese leather products in the international market, according to Ye.
In 2016, imports dipped 7 percent from the previous year to 8.9 billion U.S. dollars, Ye said.
For the first time, imports of finished leather products surpassed raw materials in value during last year.
The industry's sales revenue last year stood at 1.4 trillion yuan (203 billion U.S. dollars), up 3.2 percent year on year, 2.9 percentage points lower than that in 2015.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer confidence declined in March as holiday factors ebbed, according to an index released Wednesday.
The Bankcard Consumer Confidence Index (BCCI), compiled by Xinhua News Agency and China UnionPay, a financial services corporation, declined 1.77points from February to 86.4 in March.
The index saw month-on-month rises in both January and February thanks to the New Year and Spring Festival holidays.
"The BCCI dropped last month as holiday factors ebbed and people's lives returned to normal," a report coming along with the index said.
Use of bank cards for travel dropped 7.3 percent from a month earlier and the share of travel spending in their total consumption dropped 0.97 percentage point.
The share of card payments in restaurants declined 0.51 percentage point, the report said.
The BCCI, first released in 2009, is based on bank card transaction data and analyses of changes in urban consumption.

Roundup: Albania has much untapped potential for Chinese investors

Editor: Xiang Bo
TIRANA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Albania is interested in further strengthening economic ties with China since there is still great untapped potential that needs to be explored, officials have told Xinhua.
Dorian Ducka, External Adviser to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama on Investments, said in a written interview that China has become the fastest growing international trade partner of Albania, in both import and export terms, which is beneficial for both countries.
The effects of Made-in-China products becoming global are being felt also among Albanian market consumers, Ducka said.
"We believe that we will see a growing trend into this relation, as at the same time China is becoming one of the largest foreign investors in Albania, with a remarkable share of Albanian FDI for 2016," he said.
"Our wish and hope is that there is still so much untapped potential for Chinese investments in Albania that will bring a boost into deeper and wider economic cooperation," Ducka added.
According to him, under the cooperation of "16+1" mechanism that China has set up to boost cooperation with central and eastern Europe, Albania could be one of the main beneficiaries, especially on energy infrastructure, transport infrastructure, tourism, agriculture and water management resources.
The "16+1" mechanism is a platform created in April 2012 by China and 16 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.
"We desire to see more Chinese investments into the energy sector, especially on bringing more value added up the chain on oil by-products, and along the Gas Pipeline TAP Route for natural gas industries," he said.
Ducka also suggested that Chinese investors could make a difference through investments into the financial services such as banking and insurance companies, where Albania could benefit more also from accessing Chinese capital, both the government and the businesses.
The internationalization of the Chinese currency Renminbi could be an opportunity for Albania to maximize and optimize its potential by partnering with the world economic power such as China, Ducka said.
He also said that Albania and its government are looking forward to an upcoming visit by Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli with particular interest.
Zhang will visit Estonia, Slovenia, Albania, and attend meetings in Russia and Kazakhstan from April 11 to 19.
The Albanian government is very keen on this visit as it is a sign of economic and political relations reaching new levels of cooperation, he said.
He also hailed the Belt and Road initiative, considering it a golden opportunity not only for Albania but for whole East Europe to attract more Chinese investment and build stronger political and diplomatic relations with China.
Gjergj Buxhuku, general manager of Albanian Konfindustria and also an economic expert, told Xinhua that Albania and China needed to revive economic and trade relations.
Konfindustria, or the Confederation of the Albanian Industries, is the instituion that regroups the interests of the production and service companies in Albania.
The economic relations between the two countries are historical and they have almost been never interrupted, even during the period of the dramatic changes to the system in Albania, Buxhuku said.
According to him, recognition and friendship between the two countries is important for the cooperation of the businesses.
In this aspect, he said the friendship between the two peoples has been deep-rooted while he suggested that both countries needed to take the trade and economic relations to another level.
"We have present in Albania not only traders and the Chinese brand equipment, but also the presence of important investors in strategic sectors of the Albanian economy, such as the case of the oil company Bankers Petroleum and Tirana International Airport, TIA which are now run by Chinese companies," Buxhuku said.
He added that the necessity for promoting Chinese strategic investments had been directly requested by the state authorities of Albania in the First Albania and China Economic Forum organized by AlbKonfindustria in 2012 as part of Technology & Investments Expo.
"We should be pleased about this positive development and this strong basis for the deepening of economic relations between Albania and China," he underlined.
Buxhuku said the requirements of Albanian industries for Chinese products and technology have been steadily increasing.
"The time has come to understand that Chinese products are competitive not only in price, but also for the high quality of technology they offer. This has a great value for all sectors of the economy and the public," he noted.
However, there is still much to be done to get to know better each other's needs and opportunities in the field of business and trade exchanges, he said.
In his view, Albania could be important for Chinese investments also in terms of regional approach and in terms of closer economic and trade relations with the European Union.
Albania can also serve as a good entry gate of Chinese products in the rich markets of these countries and in the implementation of important projects in road infrastructure, railway, port, gas, electricity, etc, Buxhuku said.
He expressed the belief that business cooperation between the two countries will grow given that China has long been one of the main trading partners of Albania.

PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of China's vineyards continued to grow in 2016, confirming its position as the country with the second highest surface in the world, the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) announced in Paris.
The total size of China's vineyards increased by 17,000 hectares in 2016 for a total of 847,000 hectares, while the wine-growing surface globally was stable at 7.5 millions of hectares, the OIV said in a report published Tuesday.
In the production sector, China reached 11.4 million hectoliters (hl) in 2016, down by about one percentage compared with the previous year, while world wine production in 2016 fell to 267 million hl, a decline of 9,300 hl compared to 2015, according to OIV.
Italy, France and Spain were the three biggest producers of wine in 2016, producing 50.9, 43.5 and 39.3 million hl respectively over the past year.
China consumed 17.3 million hl of wine in 2016, an increase of 6.9 percent compared to 2015, exceeding 17 million hl for the first time since 2012, the OIV said.
The United States, France and Italy are the three largest consumers of wine in 2016, with consumption of 31.8, 27.0 and 22.5 million hl in 2016, while world wine consumption is estimated at 242 million hl, a slight increase of 0.9 million hl compared with 2015, said the OIV, noting that the consumption figures should be considered with caution taking into account the margin of error concerning worldwide monitoring.

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China will lift the retail prices of both gas and diesel for the third time this year from Thursday, amid a rally in global oil prices, the country's top economic planner announced Wednesday.
Gasoline prices will rise by 200 yuan (about 29 U.S. dollars) per tonne and the diesel price will be lifted by 190 yuan per tonne, the largest price hike this year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
This fuel price hike is inline with oil price upswings on the international market, influenced by factors including increasing demand from U.S. firms, the shutdown of one of Libya's major oilfields over the weekend and growing tension in the North African country, according to the NDRC price monitoring center.
China adjusts domestic retail oil prices when international crude prices change by more than 50 yuan per tonne in a 10 working-day period.
This is the third time this year that China has lifted retail fuel prices, leading to an accumulated gas and diesel price increase of 320 yuan and 310 yuan per tonne respectively.

SINGAPORE, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Shanghai Municipal Financial Services Office (SFSO) held the 3rd Singapore-Shanghai Financial Forum (SSFF) on Wednesday to promote financial linkages and collaborations between Singapore and China's Shanghai.
Nine Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) were signed between Singapore and Shanghai's financial institutions and corporates, according to the joint media release statement by MAS and SFSO.
An agreement was signed between Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Singapore Exchange to deepen capital market cooperation and encourage more Chinese corporates to tap Singapore's capital markets.
Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) and Bank of Shanghai also pledged to work closely together to extend their collaboration in areas such as trade finance, corporate and investment banking and loans and cross-border financing.
United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Nufin Data Private Limited further agreed to co-develop financial technology and data analytics solutions.
Meanwhile, Shanghai Municipal Financial Services Office will also work with Singapore in fostering multi-level and multi-dimensional cooperation, to further the development of the New Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Deputy Managing Director of MAS Jacqueline Loh said this edition of the SSFF takes Singapore-Shanghai financial cooperation to new heights, with entities from both sides forging agreements to work closer together.
"We will build on the strong partnership with our Shanghai counterparts to facilitate greater collaboration as we navigate the new financial world order," Loh added.

China Focus: China's consumer inflation steady amid firming economy

Consumers select goods at a supermarket in Hengshui City, north China's Hebei Province, April 8, 2017. China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, grew 0.9 percent year on year in March, the National Bureau of Statistics announced on April 12. (Xinhua/Mou Yu)
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer inflation grew mildly in March, as stable prices reinforced the view that the world's second largest economy is firming up.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, grew 0.9 percent year on year in March, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Wednesday.
The growth rate, almost on par with market expectations, quickened from an increase of 0.8 percent in February. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined 0.3 percent.
The NBS attributed the lower CPI reading to sharply lowering food prices, which fell 1.9 percent in March. Vegetable prices dropped the most, by 7.9 percent from February.
Food prices continued to drop substantially in March after price distortions created by the festival season faded. Food prices surged 27 percent in January when the festival shopping spree drove up prices.
Non-food costs rose 2.3 percent year on year, with the rate 0.1 percentage points higher than a month earlier. The costs of garments, healthcare, housing and education, entertainment and transport rose remarkably.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 2 percent in March from a year ago, almost on par with the last reading.
China's producer price index, which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 7.6 percent year on year in March. The pace slightly eased from the 7.8 percent registered in February.
Producer price inflation cooled after five months of fast increases as iron ore and coal prices eased on fears of a production glut.
"The CPI may stay muted in the near term, as agricultural supply side reform may continue to depress food prices and the headline CPI until the fourth quarter, which lowers the probability of aggressive monetary tightening, " said China International Capital Corporation in a research note.
"Looking forward, commodity prices are difficult to predict, but a continued slide would push the PPI further off its peak," said Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg. "The People's Bank of China will look for opportunities to continue nudging market rates higher. But that reflects more the need to lean against the yuan's weakness as the Federal Reserve tightens, and tamp down leverage, than concern about inflation overheating."
China's economy has shown signs of firming, reinforced by an expanding manufacturing sector, rising corporate profits, increased rail freight volume, and higher machinery sales.
The central bank has vowed to pursue a "prudent and neutral" monetary policy in 2017, promising better adjustments to ensure stable liquidity.
The upbeat data and the recent U.S. interest rate hike has prompted the PBOC to tilt toward tightening in the near term. The bank skipped open market operations of reverse repos Tuesday, for the fifth consecutive business day, siphoning liquidity from the market.
China lowered its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest target in a quarter of a century, as the government leaves leeway for economic rebalancing.
Goldman Sachs forecast in its report that the Chinese economy was likely to remain solid in the first quarter, growing 6.8 percent from a year earlier.



China to unveil central SOE mixed-ownership reform plans

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to unveil pilot mixed-ownership reform schemes for the first group of central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) soon amid efforts to invigorate its torpid SOEs.
The country is also preparing for a second round of pilot programs to begin later this year in more sectors, according to the Xinhua-run China Securities Journal.
State-owned telecom firm China Unicom is expected to incorporate private shareholders including local Internet giants via a secondary public offering.
Trading of the company's Shanghai-listed shares remained halted Wednesday as it "deliberates on major issues," according to a statement from China Unicom, which announced on April 5 that it was preparing for a mixed-ownership revamp.
An annual general meeting of shareholders scheduled for May 10 is likely to announce the reform plan allowing for cross-shareholding between the operator and Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.
Introducing the Internet trio and other powerful shareholders will offer China Unicom more marketing resources and promote its business operations, according to BOC International.
The first pilot reform scheme also includes China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Power Grid, Harbin Electric Corporation, China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation and China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation.
There are thousands of SOEs in China and they form the backbone of economic growth. But their monopolies in many sectors shut out smaller market entities and lead to low efficiency and poor service.
China has banked on mixed-ownership reform of SOEs to shore up their performance. A special meeting by China's top economic planner has called for fast and substantive progress in the SOE-dominated sectors of electricity, oil, natural gas, railway, civil aviation, telecommunication and military industry.
Reform plans should be submitted before the end of June and be implemented in the latter half of this year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.

China factory-gate inflation eases slightly

BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- China's producer price inflation slightly eased in March after widening for the past few months as commodity prices moderated, official data showed Wednesday.
China's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 7.6 percent year on year in March, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The pace slightly retreated from the 7.8 percent growth registered in February, which marked the highest since 2008.
In major industries, the upward momentum is seen as moderating. Factory-gate prices in the oil and gas extraction industry went up 68.5 percent, slowing 16.8 percentage points from the rate seen a month earlier, noted NBS senior statistician Sheng Guoqing.
Coal mining prices gained 39.6 percent, with the growth unchanged from February.
China's PPI has stayed in positive territory since September, when it ended a four-year streak of declines, partly due to the government's successful campaign to cut industrial overcapacity, which benefited the wider economy.
Month on month, the PPI edged up 0.3 percent, pulling back 0.3 percentage points from a month earlier, the third consecutive month of retreat.
Prices in key industries have shifted downward on a monthly basis, with those of coal mining and oil refining both down 0.6 percent.
"Looking forward, commodity prices are difficult to predict, but a continued slide would push the PPI further off its peak," said Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg.
Guotai Junan Securities expects the index to gradually cool but still remain at a relatively high level in the coming period.
The PPI figures came alongside the release of the consumer price index, which rose 0.9 percent in March.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said Tuesday that the insurance industry is exposed to compounded risks.
There are four major risks facing China's insurance industry, said Chen Wenhui, vice chairman of China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
Solvency risks, liquidity pressures, poor corporate governance and external issues including uncertainties of global politics and economy weigh on the sector, said Chen.
The CIRC said Monday it will tighten regulations for the industry to avoid systemic crisis.
The industry should focus on its insurance business and regulators should strictly enforce regulations, it said in a statement.
The insurance sector should guard against financial risks, support supply-side structural reform and help promote the development of the real economy, said the statement.
The statement came after China's top anti-graft authority announced that Xiang Junbo, chairman of the CIRC, was being investigated for a suspected serious violation of the code of conduct of the Communist Party of China.
Xiang is also Party chief of the CIRC.

GUANGZHOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A new freight train service started operation on Tuesday, linking Dongguan, a manufacturing hub in south China's Guangdong Province, and Vorsino, Russia.
The trip of about 11,000 kilometers takes 15 days, about one third of the time by sea, while the cost is half of that by air, said Huang Pu, chief of Dongguan customs.
A launch ceremony was held at a Sino-Russia trade logistic base, which will eventually cover 241 hectares.
Trade between Guangdong and Russia is booming, with import and export volume last year standing at 37.26 billion yuan (about 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), up 2.1 percent from the previous year. Import and export volume in January and February this year was 6.37 billion yuan, up 27.2 percent.
By last year, Dongguan customs had processed 124,000 tonnes of exported cargo, of which 6,455 tonnes was sent to Russia. The cargo includes tablet PCs, mobile phones, air conditioners, lamps, automobile parts, shoes and toys.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A graphene industry innovation center was established Tuesday in Beijing, aiming to become a world-class graphene composite technology research and industrial incubator hub.
Graphene is a flat sheet of one-atom-thick carbon with the carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Since it was first successfully isolated in 2004, it has been lauded for its outstanding potential in fields such as energy, high-tech materials, sensors, and optoelectronic devices.
Beijing Graphene Industry Innovation Center will take the advantage of Beijing's innovative resources to research and develop cutting-edge new materials. It hopes to speed up the transformation of scientific research achievements and enhance the graphene industry.
In China, which has substantial graphite deposits, more than 500 companies already specialize in graphene products.
China expects to establish a comprehensive graphene industry system by 2020, according to a plan drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2015.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Around 18,000 people were convicted on charges of intellectual property (IP) piracy and producing counterfeit products last year, said Vice Premier Wang Yang Tuesday.
Police investigated more than 200,000 cases involving IP piracy and counterfeiting last year and seized 22,000 suspects, said Wang at a national meeting on IP piracy and counterfeit control.
Authorities closed more than 200,000 accounts that were facilitating IP piracy and counterfeiting on the Internet, and handled about 2,000 websites to guarantee the market's proper operation, he said.
Laying out the essential tasks for this year, Wang said the government planned to tighten online supervision and investigate the source of production.
A special operation to prevent the trade of counterfeit products will be launched, in which cross-border trade along the Belt and Road will be under tight scrutiny, he said.
Supervision of rural markets will be enhanced, and computer software will be another priority, said Wang.
In addition, the government will promulgate relevant laws and regulations and establish a credit system to raise the cost of breaches, he said.

Xinhua Insight: China emerges as next global medical tourism hotspot

HAIKOU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Svetlana Shipetko and her two sons did not just come to south China's tropical island of Hainan to escape the freezing Siberian weather.
Shipetko had an equally important goal -- to ease her lower back pain.
Instead of prescribing painkillers, Shipetko's Chinese doctor Tang Yi performed the traditional Chinese therapy of "tuina," which literally means "push-and-pinch."
Every morning, Shipetko received the therapy at the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, then spent the rest of the day bathing in the sun.
"It is great," she told Xinhua through an interpreter. "No pills, no injections, but I feel much better."
Shipetko is one of tens of thousands of Russians who flock to Hainan every year. The island province has received 800,000 Russian tourists in the past seven years.
Almost 80 percent of them tried some form of traditional Chinese therapy during their stay -- either to treat a particular ailment or simply for wellness, health authorities said.
Rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has in recent years gained popularity in a world dominated by modern Western medicine.
Clinics have proliferated outside of China, but many face challenges such as getting herbs across the border or luring experienced professionals to work overseas.
As a result, more foreigners are coming to China for TCM treatment or therapy.
The boom is particularly felt in Sanya, where Russian-language advertisements for acupuncture pop up across the city.
GLOBAL FLOW OF PATIENTS
International medical tourism became popular in the mid-20th century with wealthy European and North American patients traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery sprees.
In the markets that first responded to the demand, such as Brazil, South Africa, and Costa Rica, a variety of modestly priced procedures were offered.
The sector flourished with the rise of quality health care, commercial aviation, and the Internet. It is now a multi-billion-dollar industry.
U.S.-based industry resource company Patients Beyond Borders estimates between 9.8 million and 14.8 million patients visited overseas hospitals and clinics in 2016.
People are tempted by lower costs, quality care, improved patient experience, specialty treatments, and the lure of "the new and different," according to the company.
It said that in 2013 alone, more than 900,000 Americans headed overseas for "nearly every imaginable type" of medical treatment: weight loss surgery in Mexico, heart valve replacements in Thailand, hip resurfacing in India, and fertility treatments in Israel.
In Asia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea are the rising stars, drawing a great majority of patients within the region.
"We see a rising market in China," said Patients Beyond Borders CEO Josef Woodman in an e-mail interview.
He said China can successfully compete with mature markets in the region, as it is strong in TCM treatment and its health care infrastructure is fast improving.
BEYOND CUPS AND NEEDLES
Acupuncture, cupping, tuina massage, and herbal medicine are some of the best-known TCM treatments overseas, but TCM master Prof. Hu Kaiwen believes the ancient healing system has even more to offer.
Hu, president of Dongfang Hospital in downtown Beijing, is a veteran oncologist who specializes in integrating TCM with conventional Western medicine to treat advanced tumor patients.
While Western medicine sees cancer as abnormal cells to be annihilated, TCM considers the ailment a sign of imbalance of body and mind and prioritizes restoring balance rather than annihilation.
Hu said one Chinese philosophical saying applies: "Going beyond the limit is as bad as falling short."
His therapy combines minimally invasive surgery with post-surgery TCM care. It offers an alternative to patients who do not respond well to chemotherapy or radiation.
Hu said the herbs can work just as well to lengthen the lifespan and improve quality of life, but cost only a fraction of costly targeted Western drugs.
Wang Tiansong, president of Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said foreign patients with cerebral palsy and strokes have also responded well to TCM treatment.
Last year, Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine set up a Chinese medicine center in St. Petersburg as an outpost.
"TCM is centered around being green and natural, making it compatible with Russians' passion for nature," said the center's Chinese director Wang Chaoyang.
INFRASTRUCTURE, PROMOTION
Hainan is not the only spot where foreign medical travelers swarm.
In China's northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Russians are joined by Kazakhs and other Central Asians from across the border.
At the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University in Urumqi, signs are written in three languages -- Chinese, Uygur, and Russian. About 80 foreigners sought treatment in the first three months after the hospital opened its international department.
Wu Yue, a top hospital official, said the demand from across the border is so strong that the hospital plans to start building an Asian Orthopedic Center.
These developments have been incorporated into the Belt and Road Initiative the Chinese leadership proposed in 2013. Xinjiang has positioned itself as a regional hub that offers services to the region, including health care.
Meanwhile, Hainan, once a key stop on the ancient Maritime Silk Road, is already being marketed as an international tourist island.
Investors now set their eyes on medical infrastructure.
A public-private-partnership cancer hospital, which cost 2.9 billion yuan (426 million U.S. dollars), opened last year in Hainan's capital city of Haikou. Equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and 1,200 beds, the hospital mainly targets wealthy treatment seekers from outside the province.
China's State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the National Development and Reform Commission late last year set a target to build 10 TCM health tourism model zones offering medical treatment, wellness, recuperation, and elder care by 2020.
Woodman said China is on the path to establishing quality health care infrastructure. In 2007, there were only three Chinese medical centers accredited by the Joint Commission International, while today there are more than 77.
The next step, he said, will be to work toward promoting China as a medical tourism destination by working with the travel and economic development sectors.
Some have sensed the business opportunity.
Russian national Yana recently quit her tour guide job to join the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine as a marketing officer.
Yana, who has been a tour guide in Sanya for 12 years, said her new job is promising.
"A lot of my Russian clients know about TCM and are interested in coming over," she said.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Private share placements by listed companies in China remained buoyant in the first three months this year despite tightened control on approvals.
During the first quarter, a total of 131 A-share listed companies conducted private share placements, raising more than 497.9 billion yuan (about 72.2 billion U.S. dollars), and 140 companies announced plans for private share placements, with 350.7 billion yuan expected to be raised, investment research firm ChinaVenture said in a research note Monday.
Companies engaged in manufacturing are a major force in the market in terms of fund raising, according to the research note.
The data showed that the private share placement market is stabilizing after brisk transactions in the fourth quarter last year, said the note.
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in February released new policies to improve the approval of private share placements by listed companies in terms of deal prices and scales to contain excessive refinancing.
The CSRC criticized certain listed companies for deviating from their main businesses, being engaged in excessive refinancing and investing in unrelated industries.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's top insurance regulator said Monday it will tighten regulations for the industry to avoid systemic crisis.
The industry should focus on its insurance business and regulators should strictly enforce regulations, said the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) in a statement.
The insurance sector should guard against financial risks, support supply-side structural reform and help promote the development of the real economy, said the statement.
The statement came after China's top anti-graft authority announced that Xiang Junbo, chairman of the CIRC, was being investigated for a suspected serious violation of the code of conduct of the Communist Party of China.
Xiang is also Party chief of the CIRC.

MADE ISLAND, Myanmar, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A 140,000-ton crude oil tanker "Suezmax" began offloading crude oil at Made Island oil port in Myanmar's western Rakhine state on Monday after the signing of a China-Myanmar crude oil pipeline transmission agreement in Beijing earlier in the day.
Made Island oil port is the starting point of the China-Myanmar crude oil pipeline which is part of the China-Myanmar oil and gas pipeline project.
The commencement of transmission of crude oil shows that the two countries have entered a new phase of energy cooperation.
The crude oil pipeline starts in Made Island, extends as long as 771 kilometers, and ends in China's Yunnan Province. The pipeline passes through Myanmar's Rakhine state, Magway and Mandalay regions and Shan state.
Built since June 2010, the oil pipeline has a designed transmission capacity of 22 million tons per year.
Once the pipeline is put into operation, Myanmar can also be provided with 2 million tons of crude oil through it annually.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, has called for more financial support for the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region, according to a statement made public Monday.
Financial institutions should find new ways to provide medium- and long-term financing for the region, PBOC deputy governor Pan Gongsheng said at a conference in Tianjin Friday.
They should increase financial support to important areas, including infrastructure, environmental protection, industrial upgrading, innovation and poverty relief, Pan added.
"The financial sector should take the strategy of Jing-Jin-Ji coordinated development as an opportunity to advance its own development," he said.
In 2015, central authorities approved a guideline for integrated development of the Jing-Jin-Ji region, with a focus on transferring non-capital functions from Beijing to neighboring areas.
The PBOC statement also said that the decision to establish the Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, an important move to advance Jing-Jin-Ji development, was also studied at the conference.

China's economy likely to grow by 6.8 pct in Q1: economists

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's GDP is likely to grow by 6.8 percent year on year in the first quarter, faster than the 6.7-percent increase in Q1 of 2016, economists said.
"China's economic growth has stabilized, with initial signs showing solid growth," said Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Center under the State Council.
Market demand at home and abroad is stable, enterprises' production has continued to recover while pressure on the production of manufactured goods has eased, Zhang was quoted as saying by the Securities Times on Monday.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.8 in March, staying in the expansion territory for an eighth consecutive month. The reading beat market expectations and was the highest in nearly five years. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion.
Lian Ping, chief economist at the Bank of Communications, said his agency raised its forecast for Q1 growth to 6.8 percent in light of investment and trade growth, among other optimistic economic data.
Growth for Q1 is scheduled to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics on April 17.
Many economists, including State Information Center economist Zhu Baoliang and CITIC Securities chief economist Zhu Jianfang, all supported the prediction of 6.8-percent Q1 growth.
For the first half, China's GDP is expected to grow by 6.7 percent year on year, the National Academy of Economic Strategy said in a report, adding that China would "without doubt" achieve its annual growth target.
The government trimmed its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest in a quarter of a century.

LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The first China-bound freight train carrying British products left London on Monday for east China, adding another terminal to the rail freight between China and Europe.
The trans-continental freight train, loaded with 32 containers carrying products including milk powder and soft drinks, started from east London' s DP World gateway to Yiwu city in central Zhejiang Province, east China.
The 12,000-km journey will pass through nine countries in 18 days.
During the trip, the train's locomotive has to be changed for several times due to different rail gauges in countries.
London is the 15th European city on an expanding map of China's rail freight. The first Chinese freight train arrived in London in January.

China's city commercial banks must guard against risks: Fitch

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- After a decade of expansion, China's city commercial banks have grown rapidly and become more important, albeit a growing source of risk, global ratings agency Fitch said Monday.
"Like mid-tier banks, city commercial banks have shifted more assets towards non-loan financial products to enhance yield, but their on-balance-sheet investment exposure is rising more quickly than that of peers," according to a recent Fitch report.
Large holdings in non-loan financial products, mostly from non-bank financial institutions, imply increasing exposure to spillover and contagion risks, it said.
"Their large investment holdings, thinning liquidity, lower profitability and weaker capital buffers render them more vulnerable to disruptions within the financial system than larger banks, with access to timely liquidity support also less certain," noted the report.
Most city commercial banks in China were transformed from city cooperatives during the mid-1990s. There were more than 130 city commercial banks in China as of the end of June 2016, said the agency, adding that sustaining local economic growth and employment is a key priority.
China's city commercial banks have grown rapidly over the past decade. Their assets grew at a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent from 2006 to 2016, higher than the 14-percent and 23-percent growth rates for state and joint stock commercial banks over the same period, respectively, it said.

SHENYANG, April 10 (China) -- German hardware giant Wurth Group opened its first retail store in northeast China's Liaoning Province on Monday.
The store, located in the China-Germany Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park in the province's capital Shenyang, displays thousands of products, such as fasteners, tools, chemical products and personal protection equipment.
"The favorable location and preferential policies of Liaoning, one of China's northeastern rust belt provinces, offered many development opportunities for investors," said Larry Stevens, CEO of Wurth China.
"We hope Wurth can introduce more advanced products and technology into this park, have further cooperation with local companies, as well as offer new ideas for the industrial development," said Li Baojun, deputy director of the management committee of the industrial park.
Founded in 2015, the China-Germany Equipment Manufacturing Industrial Park covers 48 square kilometers, attracts intelligent manufacturing, high-end equipment, automobile, industrial service and strategic emerging industries.
Wurth Group, founded in 1945, is a world market leader in the assembly and fastening material trade. It entered the Chinese market in 1994 and has 1,200 employees in more than 100 Chinese cities.

China's banking sector to enhance financial risk control

Editor: Tian Shaohui
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance risk control throughout the banking sector to eliminate financial risks in major fields, the country's top banking regulator announced Monday.
Targeted measures will be taken to address financial risks in the banking sector and stick to the bottom line of no systemic financial crisis, according to the guideline released by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
The guideline outlines detailed fields for enhanced risk control, including traditional sectors such as credit, liquidity, real estate and local government debt as well as non-traditional areas including bonds, financial products, Internet finance and cross-border financial impact.
Chinese lenders saw the ratio of their non-performing loans fall to 1.74 percent at the end of 2016, slightly down from 1.76 percent a quarter ago.
Top leaders of banking institutions should be in charge of risk control efforts and there will be stricter supervision and punishment over irregularities in the sector, according to the guideline.
In the first quarter of this year, the CBRC imposed administrative penalties for 485 cases of irregularities in the sector with fines totaling 190 million yuan (about 27.52 million U.S. dollars).

SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese conglomerate HNA Group announced its plan to buy Singapore's logistics provider CWT at 2.33 Singapore dollars per share for about 1.4 billion Singapore dollars (995.82 million U.S. dollars) on late Sunday.
The deal was a result of almost a year of negotiations between the two sides.
The offer at 2.33 Singapore dollars a share is higher than CWT's last traded price at 2.07 Singapore dollars.
Local media reported that one pre-condition of the offer is that shareholders of HNA Holding Group must vote to approve the CWT takeover.
According to reports reaching here, HNA intends to make CWT its wholly-owned subsidiary.
In addition, HNA is likely to keep the senior management team of CWT's main business unit to maintain the operations of CWT.
CWT is a leading provider of integrated logistics and supply chain solutions and was once the warehousing and logistics arm of government-linked port operator PSA. (1 Singapore dollar = 0.71 U.S. dollar)

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's rapidly expanding financial industry is being placed under greater regulatory scrutiny as authorities step up efforts to curb widespread malfeasance in the sector.
In remarks published Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pointed out that the country's financial sector was vulnerable to risks such as bad assets, bond defaults, shadow banking and Internet financing, with frequent illegal and corrupt activities.
To put the market in order, the premier urged for efforts to crack down on bank violations on giving credit, insider trading in securities market and fraud of insurance companies, as well as to relentlessly punish internal supervisors and company managers who collude with major players in the market and steal and sell confidential information.
On the same day, China's top anti-graft authority announced that Xiang Junbo, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, was being investigated for suspected serious violation of the code of conduct of the Communist Party of China.
Li's message was the latest from high-level officials who have repeatedly highlighted the importance of containing financial risks as the country faces a build-up of debt and booming new financial products challenge regulations.
Since China's tone-setting economic conference last December pledged preventing financial risks as a priority, regulators from the banking, securities and insurance sectors have made solid efforts to clean up the market.
In the first quarter of 2017, China's banking regulator meted out 485 administrative penalties with fines totalling 190 million yuan (about 27.54 million U.S. dollars).
A total of 197 people were held accountable for banking irregularities in the period, of which 19 were disqualified for executive positions and 11 barred from banking business, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
Yang Jiacai, assistant to the CBRC chairman, disclosed that the commission would create more guidelines to better regulate the market.
In the capital market, China's securities regulator has maintained zero tolerance on illegal market activities such as insider trading and stock manipulation, after the market rout in 2015 shattered investor confidence.
Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) slapped a 3.47 billion yuan fine on a company chairman for stock market manipulation, a record high.
The fine received by Xian Yan, chairman of P2P Financial Information Service Co., approached the total of fines handed out by the CSRC for all of last year, showing the regulator's determination to rein in risky behavior.
Grabbing headlines, the "barbaric" behavior of some Chinese insurers that use leveraged money to buy shares in listed companies triggered sharp volatility in the market at the end of last year.
China's insurance regulator barred Yao Zhenhua, chairman of Foresea Life Insurance, from the insurance sector for 10 years for irregular market operations.
The slew of high-profile punishments in the financial system underscore government determination to balance stable growth and financial risk control, according to analysts.
To make risk control more effective, China needs to reform its financial regulation system to put cross-market and cross-sector financial services under more coordinated scrutiny, according to senior officials.
Wang Zhaoxing, vice chairman of CBRC, said at a forum earlier this year that the commission would strengthen coordination and information sharing with the insurance and securities regulators as well as the central bank to plug loopholes in regulation.
Despite latent risks, China is confident of preventing systemic financial troubles.
At a press conference after the conclusion of the annual legislative session last month, Premier Li struck a confident tone on the country's financial stability, ruling out the possibility of systemic risks as "the country has plenty of policy options at its disposal."
"China's budget deficit to GDP ratio stands below 3 percent, the capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks is 13 percent and their provision coverage ratio is at 176 percent, all above the international standards for financial security," Li said.

BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank skipped the open market operations of reverse repos Monday.
This was the eleventh consecutive business day that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has halted the process, where it purchases securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.

SHANGHAI, April. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix of 2017 featured a local manufacturer of automotive wheels - Dicastal, part of the Citic Group-strengthen the cooperation with Williams F1 team, as the two parties announced here on Sunday that Dicastal will be the tyre supplier of the top F1 team.
Wang Jiong, the vice president of Citic Group, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency that this cooperation not only means a huge step for Dicastal, but also be of great significance for Chinese manufacture industry.
"Chinese manufacturers were often regarded as resource-intensive or labor intensive ones, but lack of competitiveness in high-tech products. As one of the stated-owned enterprise, we felt obliged to change the stereotype of Chinese manufactures and try to compete with foreign companies in some high-tech areas," said Wang.
"In terms of automobile industry, there is no doubt that F1 is the top of the industry pyramid. Only the very top manufacturers in the world can become the suppliers of the F1 racing events. We set the goal to enter this area in the year of 2010, I told our staff that we should try to work with world top clients, just F1 racing teams."
Established in 1988, Dicastal had become the world's leading manufacturer of aluminum wheels. But cooperating with F1 was still a big challenge for them that time as this exciting racing sport has vigorous requirement on auto parts.
"Of course it's not easy to meet the F1 standards, we should improve our techniques to compete with our opponents. Speaking of tires, even one gram can make big difference. The best tyre should be as light as possible and also of high quality to be used in the top auto events in the world." Wand continued.
Dicastal's efforts were paid back in 2016, as they set up technical partnership with Williams. In their partnership, Dicastal's wheels would go through vigorous R&D (Research and Development) with Williams Martini Racing before on track product testing begins in 2017.
When commenting on the partnership, Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal and Commercial Director of Williams said:"Here at Williams, we are always looking for the slightest advantage to edge out the competition, and light weighting is fundamental to that. As an organization, Dicastal's dedication to engineering excellence perfectly matches our own and we look forward to working together."
This year during the Chinese Grand Prix, the relationship went further as Dicastal will be the tyre supplier for Williams since 2018, becoming the first Chinese manufacturer to produce any part of F1 racing cars.
"Our success comes from years of accumulation and innovation. I hope more Chinese manufacturers enter the high-tech areas in the future and convert 'made in China' to 'created in China', Wang said.

BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China has great potential in applications of artificial intelligence (AI), a senior official said Sunday.
"Chinese researchers and entrepreneurs are among the best in the world, with technological innovations and good earnings in the sector," said Liu Lihua, vice minister of industry and information technology.
Researchers with Chinese companies such as iFlytek, Alibaba and Baidu participated in the study of the world's leading AI technologies, said Liu, referring to technologies of reinforcement learning, paying with your face and self-driving trucks.
A couple of weeks ago, the "MIT Technology Review" listed the above three and another seven technologies as its 10 breakthrough technologies in 2017.
AI research started more than 60 years ago and there have been some major ups and downs. The current wave is backed by unprecedented quantities of data and computing power.
"While we are just getting started, we have made prominent progress in applying artificial intelligence in smart city and intelligent customer service on automobiles," said Liu.
More sectors will see AI applications in the future, he added.
Chinese Internet giants are focusing on the development of artificial intelligence and believe the next decades will be a golden age for the industry.
"If we define 2016 as the first year of China's artificial intelligence, this year will be the beginning of applications of artificial intelligence in the country," said Liu Qingfeng, board chairman of tech firm iFlytek Co. Ltd.
Internet giant Baidu set up a national deep learning technology lab in Beijing in March. The lab gathered AI experts from Baidu, Tsinghua University, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
"The Internet is just an appetizer. The main course will be AI. In the future, machines will develop to a point where they can understand humans and their intentions," said Li Yanhong, chair of Baidu, at the China IT Summit in Shenzhen last Sunday.
Baidu has invested heavily in machine-aided study, image recognition, voice recognition and driverless vehicles.
Another tech giant Xiaomi set up an "Explorer's Lab" last year to research artificial intelligence and will release an "exciting AI product" in the coming six months, according to Lei Jun, founder and CEO of Xiaomi.
"Companies in emerging markets need to offer their consumers a compelling vision so that they not only resolve problems today, but even address problems on the horizon," Lei said.
China will make greater efforts this year to implement innovation-driven development strategy, upgrade the structure of the real economy, and improve its performance and competitiveness, according to the government work report issued last month.
"We will accelerate R&D on and commercialization of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications, and other technologies, and develop industrial clusters in these fields," the report read.
In May last year, the government made a three-year action plan to develop AI.
The industry's market size was 23.9 billion yuan (about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars) last year, and will reach 38 billion yuan (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
"As the AI era approaches, we should focus on technological innovation, establish industry standards and specifications, forge an industrial ecosystem, and speed up legislation in the sector," said iFlytek's Liu.

HANGZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua ) -- Alibaba, a dominant player in China's e-commerce, has teamed up with several non-governmental environmental protection organizations to protect water resources in the country.
Alibaba Foundation and the organizations formed an alliance Saturday at a meeting on water resources protection and green development, which was held in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province.
Members of the alliance include Alibaba Foundation, Friends of Nature, Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, Green Hunan, and Beijing Green Foundation.
At the same time, Alibaba Foundation and Green Hunan, based in central China's Hunan Province, announced to set up a river-guarding center. They plan to have 2, 000 people serving as "folk river chiefs" in the Yangtze River valley in three years. These folk river chiefs will be engaged in reporting issues such as stinky waters, and participate in protection of water sources.
The public should be encouraged to take part in environmental protections, said Jin Jianhang with Alibaba Foundation. "We should promote the disclosure of environmental information and make it visual, so that the public at anytime can focus on the environmental issues."
Fang Min, director of Zhejiang provincial environmental protection department, said environmental protection requires participation of the whole society.
A new pattern led by the government, with coordination of different departments, engagement of all social sectors and public supervision, can be formed through efforts such as cross-sector cooperation and unified actions,and win-win results be achieved, according to Fang.
"We hope to work with more organizations to promote the rule of law in the field of environment," said Zhang Boju, secretary general of Beijing Friends of Nature Foundation.
In December 2016, China began to appoint "river chiefs" with responsibilities which include resource protection, pollution prevention and control, and ecological restoration. Their performance will be assessed and they will be held accountable for environmental damage in bodies of water under their supervision.
Environmental protection and restoration is a top priority of the development plan for the Yangtze River economic belt, which accommodates over 600 million people with about one fifth of China's land.
According to statistics of China Environmental Organization Map, there are currently more than 2,000 non-governmental environmental protection organizations across the country.

BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is likely to remain solid in the first quarter of this year, growing 6.8 percent from a year earlier, Goldman Sachs forecast.
The bank said in a research report that purchasing managers' index (PMI) readings from both official and private surveys have implied firm activity growth overall. It expected China's GDP growth to reach 6.6 percent for 2017.
Goldman Sachs expected China's industrial production to rise 6.4 percent in March, slightly higher than the 6.3 percent growth for January and February.
Fixed asset investment growth is likely to remain strong, expanding 8.9 percent in the first three months of the year, unchanged from that in the first two months, according to Goldman Sachs.
It expected weaker auto sales to continue weighing on the country's retail sales, which may increase 9.4 percent in March, slowing from the 9.5 percent growth registered in the first two months.
The bank said growth of the country's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, may rebound to 1.3 percent in March from 0.8 percent in February as distortions from the Chinese New Year effect disappeared.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, China's economy grew 6.8 percent year on year. The Chinese government has targeted growth of around 6.5 percent this year.
The country is scheduled to release its first-quarter economic data, including GDP growth, fixed asset investment, industrial output and retail sales, on April 17.

Feature: Construction of China-Laos railway speeding up before rainy season

By Zhang Jianhua
MUANG PHONHONG, Laos, April 9 (Xinhua) -- "This is my office, and also my bedroom," Project Manager Cai Li told Xinhua reporter while pointing at a small tent amid the roar of generator.
Located at the construction site of China-Laos railway in Muang Phonhong district in Lao central Vientiane Province, Cai's so-called "office and bedroom" is made from simple bamboo shelves covered by large plastic sheets. There is no working table in her "office" but only a bed, while office equipments and materials were placed on the floor.
"We have only electric fan to cool down the heat. I slept only three or four hours a day these days. So fortunately the chef came the day before so we are now able to have good meals," the 50-year-oldspider manager talked about her living conditions at the site. Cai has just arrived at the site of China-Laos railway in Muang Phonhong for one week.
"There is no other way because we have to rush to take advantages of dry season in Laos for construction," she said. Chinese companies are speeding up the construction of China-Laos railway after entering its first dry season since the railway construction was officially started on Dec. 25, 2016.
It is now dry season in Laos, the main construction period in tropical monsoon climate zone. Specifically for China-Laos railway construction, it is necessary to create favorable conditions for construction before the rainy season. For example, the tunnel must be excavated to a certain depth before the rainy season otherwise high rainfall might cause landslides.
China-Laos railway is a major strategic project which was reached and promoted by top leaders of the two countries. Speaking at the construction inaugural ceremony of China-Laos railway in late 2016, General Manager of China Railway International Co., Ltd and Chairman of Laos-China Railway Company Huang Difu said the China Railway Corporation will take the best of its advantages on railway management, technology and resources to lead other enterprises on survey and design, construction and equipment manufacturing among others, as well as cooperate with Lao government and relevant enterprises in order to construct and operate China-Laos railway in a good manner.
Huang pledged to resolutely implement the consensus reached by the two governments on railway construction and operation. On the basis of initial results, the company will continue strengthen communication and collaboration with Lao government at all levels, support each other, follow the plan and requirements so as to ensure high standards of quality and schedule, contributing to promoting socio-economic development of the two countries and prosperity of the two peoples.
China Railway No. 2 Group Co., Ltd is responsible for the construction of Muang Phonhong section. He Hongsong, head of construction commanding department of China Railway No. 2 Group Co., Ltd told Xinhua that the department held a meeting in early April to launch a campaign of "a 100-day of dry season working competition" to ensure the goal of full construction commence in June.
"We need to rush into the site and set up a safe, high quality working manner within 100 days in order to show the construction level of China railway agencies who dare to battle tough working conditions," Huang Ningshu, Party Secretary of the construction commanding department, said.
At the same time, the Lao side is also actively promoting the progress of China-Laos railway construction. At the end of March, the import of materials and equipments for railway construction embraced difficulties in Lao customs clearance. Right in early April, Lao government established a working group to approve the tax-free import of materials and equipments as well as set up a special lane for imports of materials and equipments for China-Laos railway construction.
Sometimes, villagers living near the construction site of China-Laos railway in Muang Phonhong took their children on motycycles to the site for visit. Keobouphon Xayani (according to pronunciation), a Muang Phonhong villager, told reporter that villagers have been actively coordinating in construction demolition, while the initial construction of the railway has brought benefits to local residents.
"It is now easier for villagers to find jobs, while sales of agricultural products are better," the village chief told reporter.
The China-Laos railway has a total length of 414.332 kilometers with over 62.7 percent of bridges and tunnels, linking Mohan-Boten border gate in northern Laos and capital Vientiane. Operating speed on the route is designed at 160 km per hour. Construction of the project is scheduled for five years with investment of some 40 billion Chinese yuan (5.8 billion U.S. dollars), 70 percent of which comes from Chinese investment and the rest 30 percent from Lao side.
China-Laos railway is the first overseas route connecting with the railway system in China, using Chinese technology, equipment and investment.

HOHHOT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A freight train fully loaded with Russian wheat arrived at Manzhouli land port in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Saturday.
This is the first bulk shipment of Russian wheat to enter China via the land port after the two countries reached deals on quarantine inspection requirements for exporting Russian wheat, corn, rice and soybean to China in December 2015.
China's state-owned foodstuff conglomerate COFCO Corp. is responsible for quality control, import and distribution to the Chinese market.
COFCO president Yu Xubo said the group plans to import 1 million to 2 million tonnes of wheat from Russia a year. This may increase to 4 million or 5 million tonnes a year in the future, he said.
Russia replaced the United States as the world's top wheat exporter last year with 25 million tonnes of exports, according to figures provided by the Russian side.
"Compared with ocean shipping, land transport via Manzhouli cuts travel time and costs," said Chen Lixin, Party chief of Manzhouli City.
He said China's import of Russian wheat is a new breakthrough in bilateral trade and economic cooperation achieved within the framework of the Belt and Road initiative.

Major developers with good reputations gained an advantage over smaller companies amid recent government curbs on the property sector, while some developers might have accelerated sales to lock in profits before the market cools later this year as expected, the newspaper said.
The central government is trying to rein housing prices in major cities where huge demand and limited supply have pushed prices to record highs.
Major cities are taking fresh measures including increased deposits for second-home buyers, adding to the slew of steps taken since October in dozens of cities to prevent home prices from rising out of control.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The central government has continued to cut its annual budget for overseas trips, vehicles and receptions this year.
Central government departments will spend a maximum of 6.15 billion yuan (891 million U.S. dollars) on the "three public consumptions" in 2017, down 31 million yuan from 2016, according to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
Expenses on overseas visits will reach no more than 1.88 billion yuan, while 3.5 billion yuan was budgeted for the purchase and maintenance of government vehicles and 761 million yuan for official receptions.
The MOF said the 2017 budget will give a priority to funding important overseas visits, reception of foreign guests, as well as participation in international meetings.
In addition, central departments will need to replace their vehicles with greener cars in line with Beijing's policy on emission reduction, the MOF said.
China has long been bedeviled by officials using their expenses accounts to travel in the name of official visits, use work vehicles on personal errands, and enjoy luxurious receptions and accommodation.
However, the frugality campaign launched by central authorities is driving down the expenses in a bid to build a cleaner and more transparent government.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The securities regulator on Saturday vowed to severely punish listed firms that violate market rules or fail to pay dividends when due.
Listed firms that engage in "illicit practices" on the stock market should "pay a heavy price," Liu Shiyu, head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a meeting of the China Association for Public Companies.
He criticized some companies, without naming them, for forging financial information, engaging in fraudulent restructuring, and cashing out after driving stock prices high at the cost of retail investors' interests.
He also urged firms to pay dividends to their investors, saying authorities will "act hard" against those who fail to do so without justified reasons.
He reiterated that the CSRC remained committed to protecting the rights and interests of retail investors, who dominate China's stock market.
China currently has over 3,100 listed companies, with a combined market value exceeding 50 trillion yuan (7.25 trillion U.S. dollars).
Listed firms should play an active role in the implementation of national strategies and avoid blind expansion into non-core business, Liu told the meeting.
He stressed good corporate governance and full information disclosure, saying credit records should be built for company directors and management.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing announced plans Friday to supply 6,000 hectares of land by 2021 in a bid to meet the market demand of 1.5 million units of residential houses.
Beijing plans to supply 5,000 hectares of state-owned construction land and 1,000 hectares of collectively-owned construction land in the following five years, according to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning and Land and Resources Management.
Seventy percent of the land will be used for the construction of residential houses with property rights, while 30 percent of the land will be used to build rental houses.
In 2017, Beijing will offer about 1,200 hectares of residential land to build 300,000 units of residential housing.
Analysts said the rising supply of residential land is aimed at relieving the supply-demand contradiction in Beijing's property market and help stabilize housing prices.
In March, Beijing introduced a spate of measures, including higher down payments, higher mortgage rates and tougher purchase restrictions, to cool the red-hot property market.

China sees improvement in overdue payments risks in 2016: survey

SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- About 68 percent of Chinese companies experienced overdue payments in 2016, down from the average of 80 percent over the previous five years, according to a survey on China corporate payments by global credit insurance company Coface.
Construction remained China's most at-risk sector in 2016 with 45.9 percent of companies reporting 2 percent or more of their turnover as being overdue for an ultra-long period of time. It will be another challenging year for highly indebted construction corporate in 2017, against a backdrop of tighter monetary and credit conditions.
Only about 40 percent of respondents said they used credit management tools to mitigate non-payment risks, indicating that greater risk management efforts needed to be made in China.
Credit insurance is an effective tool to protect companies against non-payment risks caused by protracted default or insolvency of their buyers. It is commonly used by companies in Europe, and the usage rate can be as high as 30 percent in advanced countries such as France and Germany, according to the survey.
In China, it is estimated that less than 2 percent of export trade is covered by credit insurance, and less than 5 percent of companies use credit insurance to protect what they receive.
"The Chinese market continues to grow and the coverage of credit insurance to support export trade has increased rapidly recent years," the survey said.
"Our group will continue to invest in the China market to help Chinese companies to go global, and offer them credit insurance solutions that aim to protect businesses against the risk of financial default worldwide," said Coface CEO Xavier Durand.
Coface began conducting annual surveys on business payments in China in 2003, aiming of understanding corporate credit management practices and payment experiences across the country.
In the 2016 survey, valid responses were received from 1,017 China-based companies, including private companies, state-owned companies, wholly owned foreign companies and joint ventures.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top banking regulator on Friday vowed to strengthen supervision and punishment over irregularities in the sector to enhance risk control and improve financial services for the country's real economy.
Wang Zhaodi, head of the on-site inspection bureau of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), told a press briefing that the regulator would focus on irregularities this year, including those in equities, outbound investment, financial businesses and illegal financial activities.
"The CBRC will demand all banks make self-examinations and self-correction that would cover all the personnel, products and businesses in the banking system," said Yang Jiacai, assistant to the CBRC chairman at the briefing.
"The non-stop emergence of new financial products and businesses in recent years has given rise to irregularities in the banking sector," said Yang, who promised strict supervision and punishment to ensure regulatory effectiveness.
In the first quarter of this year, the CBRC imposed administrative penalties on 485 cases with fines totalling 190 million yuan (about 27.54 million U.S. dollars).
A total of 197 people were held accountable for banking irregularities in the three month period, of which 19 were disqualified for executive positions and 11 suspended from positions in banking, according to the CBRC.
In a guideline released Friday, the CBRC said banks and financial institutions should continue differentiated credit policies on the property market to promote the long-term and steady development of the real estate market.
The regulator also called on banks to support national development strategies, satisfy financial demand of key sectors and boost the development of consumer finance.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has vowed to provide support enhancing the China-Europe freight trains route.
"We will help shorten the transit time of China-Europe freight trains via Mongolia and provide fast customs clearance services," said B.Tsogtgerel, deputy minister of the Mongolian Road and Transport Development Ministry, Friday.
In 2016, Chinese authorities announced the freight train route, which starts in Erlianhaote in northern China's Inner Mongolia and travels through Mongolia before linking to Russia and other European countries.
"There were 167 China-Europe freight trains travelling through Mongolia in 2016 and that is expected to reach 400 in 2017," said Tsogtgerel at the "Transit Mongolia 2017" forum in Beijing. "The train route via Mongolia will help develop the rich resources in Mongolia and promote the common development of countries along the route."
In 2011, China launched the China-Europe freight train service, which has witnessed rapid growth with high operation efficiency.
A total of 1,881 China-Europe freight trains, including 502 inbound trains, have been launched as of June 2016. The number is estimated to reach 5,000 by 2020. China-Europe trade value over the route hit 17 billion U.S. dollars during the period.

China's forex reserves rise for second month in a row

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China's forex reserves rose for the second month in a row in March, signaling eased capital flight pressure, central bank data showed Friday.
Forex reserves climbed to 3.0091 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of March from 3.0051 trillion dollars a month earlier, according to statistics from the People's Bank of China.
This was the first time the reserves expanded for two months consecutively since April 2016.
The country's forex regulator said cross-border capital flows became more balanced in March, citing overall stability in international financial markets.
In the first quarter of 2017, forex reserves dropped by a total of 1.4 billion dollars, a markedly smaller decline than in the previous two quarters, said the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) in a statement.
It showed the pressure of capital flight has been alleviated as the Chinese economy stabilized, the SAFE said.
It predicted the size of forex reserves to become more stable in the future as the economy maintains relatively fast growth and the country's current account surplus stays in a reasonable range.
There had been growing concerns about capital flowing out of the Chinese market in the second half of 2016, when the economy was facing looming downward pressures and the Chinese yuan was in the middle of a losing streak against the U.S. dollar.
In January, China's forex reserves declined below the closely watched 3-trillion-dollar mark for the first time since February 2011.
However, concerns about capital outflows have receded lately, with the Chinese economy on a firmer footing, supported by a string of upbeat data including industrial profits, factory activity and fixed asset investment.

SHENZHEN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen has issued a document outlining advice and regulations to help the city's booming, yet chaotic, bike-sharing market.
There are seven bike-sharing companies operating in Shenzhen, which manage around 520,000 bikes that had been used by over 9 million users by the end of March. Up to 2.5 million trips are taken every day on average.
According to the regulations, bike-sharing companies should have designated bank accounts to hold deposits. They should ensure their users' data is safe and secure.
Should a company want to cease operation, it must make the decision public at least 20 days before it intends to close, and refund all deposits and account balance to its users, the document added.
The document suggested that the city government should support the healthy development of the market and provide infrastructure support. Furthermore, the number of share bikes should not exceed the city's occupancy and load capacity.
Companies must also share information with local traffic management and police departments on the number of registered users, the number of bikes on the road and their distribution and how frequently they are used.

SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- After 20 years of doing business in China, U.S. medical technology firm Medtronic chose Shanghai as the site for its first bioprosthetic heart valve manufacturing site outside the America.
"The manufacturing site represents... a positive collaboration between Medtronic and our local business partners to increase healthcare access," said Omar Ishrak, chairman and CEO of Medtronic. The Shanghai site opened at the end of March.
Ishrak said the 13 million-U.S.-dollar plant in Shanghai is one of Medtronic's most advanced facilities for processing and production of bioprosthetic valves. It produces bioprosthetic valves, which are used for treatment to restore heart's normal blood flow.
Medtronic's heart valve manufacturing site in China is the company's another development plan deepening footprint in this market. This follows other important investments including the blood dialysis systems and insulin pumps projects in Chengdu.
U.S. companies expect better U.S.-China economic ties to benefit their businesses.
Joe Mastrangelo, president and CEO of GE Power's Gas Power Systems, has followed the development of China's electricity industry closely.
In March, the U.S. company teamed up with Harbin Electric Corporation to establish a joint venture, each holding a 50 percent stake. The joint venture, with a registered capital of 667 million yuan (97 million U.S. dollars), produces the world's advanced gas turbines and parts.
The new firm will be based in Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, north China.
Mastrangelo said they are confident in the joint venture, in cooperative partners and in the China market.
In addition to furthering investment, established U.S. firms like Apple are also looking to China's abundant talent pool.
Apple announced in March it would establish two additional R&D centers in Shanghai and Suzhou, joining centers previously announced in Beijing and Shenzhen.
"By expanding our plans for R&D centers in China, we look forward to working collaboratively with even more local partners and academic institutions," said Dan Riccio, Apple senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.
"The talent and entrepreneurial spirit in China is incredible, and we are fortunate to be working with these developers and suppliers as we grow our presence here," said Riccio.
China has been loosening the grip on the inflow of foreign capital as part of efforts to facilitate its opening up, reducing restrictive measures and opening more sectors. In 2016, laws on foreign investment were amended, and measures were unveiled to simplify the approval procedure for foreign companies.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, China utilized some 126 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 2016, a year-on-year increase of 4.1 percent, while global foreign direct investment plummeted.
By the end of 2016, U.S. companies had invested nearly 80 billion U.S. dollars in 67,000 projects in China, accounting for 7.8 percent of China's approved foreign-funded enterprises and 4.5 percent of its actualized foreign investment. Around 90 percent of U.S. companies in China have been profitable, according to a report released October by the U.S.-China Business Council based Washington.

SHANGHAI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- In addition to 600 million yuan (87 million U.S. dollars) in box office sales in China so far, the Hollywood blockbuster "Beauty and the Beast" has given rise to countless hot-selling products.
Beast-themed puppets and tea cups often sell out at Shanghai Disneyland, and the 30-plus types of dessert based on the movie have become top choices for movie fans at Shanghai Disneyland Hotel.
Tina Dai, a merchandise team member at Shanghai Disney Resort, said the resort is planning to restock the ceramic teacups, based on one of the characters in the movie, which sell for 85 yuan each.
"The popularity of movie-based products shows consumers' keen interest in Disney characters and movie stories," she said.
While China is shifting its growth engine from the industrial to the service sector, U.S. companies are exploring new growth points.
Statistics show China-U.S. service trade exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars in 2016.
Global coffee chain Starbucks is among the beneficiaries of the huge Chinese market.
The corporation's fiscal report released in late January showed comparable store sales increased 6 percent in China, 3 percentage points higher than global growth for the quarter that ended January 1, 2017. Net quarterly revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment grew 18 percent year on year to 770.8 million U.S. dollars.
The robust sales growth is partly due to cooperation between Starbucks and Chinese Internet giant Tencent, which has offered mobile payment services for Chinese customers since December.
The two companies have also rolled out a digital gift-giving service on WeChat, allowing WeChat users to send and receive Starbucks digital gifts and then cash them in at offline outlets.
Starbucks is the first retail brand to use the digital gift-sharing service, supported by the social network's 846 million monthly active users.
While China is developing a consumption-driven economy, many sectors such as logistics services will improve to better serve Chinese consumers, David Bell, a business professor with the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said while visiting Shanghai Jiaotong University last month.
Last year Amazon China launched a Prime service, offering free shipping to its paid members.
Prime members will receive their packages from around the world within five to nine working days by air delivery and other time-saving procedures. Regular customers have to wait between two weeks and a month for cross-border delivery, said Zhang Wenyi, president of Amazon China.
Zhang said the number of active users in China as of the end of 2016 was 23 times the number in 2014, and more and more Chinese sellers are seeking fortunes in the overseas market via Amazon.
For example, ILIFE, a robotic cleaning device developed by a Shenzhen-based company, is ranked in third place among similar products in the U.S. market, said Zhang, without disclosing the sales volume or revenue.
"We have seen huge market potential with more and more Chinese customers buying from around the world on e-commerce platforms, and more and more American customers choosing quality products made in China," he said.
Gan Chunhui, deputy head of the China Society of Industrial Economics, said the consumption-driven economy developing in China not only means rising demand for consumption and services, but also will help promote upgrades throughout the industrial chain
American projects in China, for example, have benefited the traditional manufacturing industry elsewhere so that other countries may also participate in the new economy, said Gan.
Many of the ceramic products sold at Shanghai Disneyland, for example, are manufactured in Thailand.
"With value-added products based on intellectual property, traditional manufacturing will release new vitality," he said.

China, Australia to prepare for FTA upgrade talks: ministry

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia will prepare to begin talks on upgrading a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) between the two nations, a commerce ministry official said Thursday.
Sun Jiwen, spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce, made the remarks at a press briefing in response to a question over a statement of intent signed during Premier Li Keqiang's official visit to Australia in late March.
The two sides will start reviewing the China-Australia FTA (ChAFTA) chapters on service trade and investment, as well as a memorandum of understanding on investment facilitation this year, according to the statement of intent.
This will pave the way for starting ChAFTA upgrade talks "when appropriate," said Sun.
ChAFTA took effect in December 2015. In 2016, 85 percent of bilateral goods trade benefited from tariff reductions, while Chinese enterprises made 3.68 billion U.S. dollars in direct investment to Australia, up 56 percent year on year.
China and New Zealand will start the first round of talks on upgrading the China-New Zealand FTA, which took effect in 2008, from April 25 to 27 in Beijing, according to Sun.

Hong Kong financial institutions aim to partner with FinTech firms: survey

HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a multinational professional network, launched its 2nd Global FinTech Survey, showing that 82 percent of financial institutions in Hong Kong intend to form partnerships with financial technology (FinTech) companies in the next three to five years, the organization said here Thursday.
"The survey respondents in Hong Kong are showing a very pragmatic response to the challenge thrown down by FinTech start-ups," Matthew Phillips, Financial Services leader for PwC China and Hong Kong said in the report.
"The incumbents are looking for a win-win," he said, "They can import culture change through partnership, and the start-ups can more easily gain penetration."
PwC sees significant potential for Hong Kong to play a regional role.
However, the survey finds that there are some issues that can dampen enthusiasm for these partnerships. About 60 percent of Hong Kong respondents are concerned by the regulatory uncertainty that could arise, while 70 percent of Hong Kong respondents believe FinTech firms can increase information security and privacy threats.
"While there are challenges, the survey highlights a number of exciting opportunities in the FinTech sector in Hong Kong," Henri Arslanian, FinTech and RegTech lead for PwC China and Hong Kong said.
Respondents here show strong interest in Robotic Process Automation and other RegTech solutions that can greatly reduce the cost of compliance, he said, adding that it presents a unique opportunity for Hong Kong to position itself as a hub for such services that can then be successfully exported regionally.

China rises to 15th in global tourism competitiveness ranking: report

Editor: Xiang Bo
GENEVA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China has risen two positions to the 15th in the latest global tourism competitiveness ranking released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Thursday.
The forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017 ranks 136 countries and regions across 14 dimensions, revealing how well countries could deliver sustainable economic and societal benefits through their travel and tourism sector.
While advanced economies, such as Spain, France and Germany, continue to top the rankings, 12 of the top 15 most improved countries are emerging markets, with Asia's as exponents.
"The rise of Asia's giants shows that the Asian Tourism Century is becoming a reality," said Tiffany Misrahi, WEF's community lead of the aviation, travel and tourism Industries.
As one of the Asia's giants, China received nearly 57 million tourists in 2016, which accounted for over 20 percent of international arrivals in Asia, says the report.
It attributes the improvement of China's tourism competitiveness ranking mainly to the country's increased international openness, improved ICT (information and communications technology) readiness and further investments in its tourist service infrastructure.
China's increased prioritization of its travel and tourism industry has also supported its rise, says the report.
Meanwhile, the WEF report suggests more measures to support the country's continued rise in the ranking, including creating more accommodation capacity beyond the larger cities, a more enabling environment for doing business, and environmental sustainability to ensure the preservation of its unique natural resources.
The report also sees China as a largest source market in the region with nearly 128 million departures registered in 2015. But the potential is still huge, as the report finds out that only 5 percent of China's population hold a passport.
It also finds that the increasingly protectionist global context, one that is hindering global trade, is not holding back international travel.
According to WEF's statistics, the global travel and tourism sector accounts for 10 percent of global GDP and provides one in 10 jobs worldwide.

China strengthens control of housing, land use

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A government statement released Thursday outlined the steps taken to prevent housing and land price hikes.
The circular, jointly issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and Ministry of Land and Resources, said that local governments should stop land deal if current inventories will take more than 36 months to be shifted.
Local governments should disqualify any bid backed by capital from questionable sources, said the circular.
The circular demanded that local authorities make bidding flexible, and outline punishments for inadequate or fabricated work by local authorities.
It said that cities and counties that have more than one million inhabitants should make three-year (2017-2019) and a five-year (2017-2021) plans for housing land supply, and make the plans public by the end of June.
Sales of land for residential projects almost doubled in China's first-tier cities during January-March, according to China Index Academy, a property research organization.
Land sales in major cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, totaled 5.08 million square meters in the first quarter, an increase of 98 percent from a year ago, the highest for the past two years.
The government is trying to cool runaway housing prices in major cities where huge demand and limited supply have pushed prices to record high.
Major Chinese cities are taking fresh measures including increased deposits for second-home buyers, adding to the slew of steps taken since October in dozens of cities to prevent home prices from rising out of control.

China needs to accelerate structural reforms to support growth: ADB

HONG KONG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China needs to accelerate structural reforms to boost productivity and sustain growth momentum, says an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report released here Thursday.
In its Asian Development Outlook 2017, ADB projects gross domestic product (GDP) growth for China moderating to 6.5 percent in 2017 and 6.2 percent in 2018, from 6.7 percent last year.
China's efforts to transform the country to a more consumption and service-driven economy is well under way, said Yasuyuki Sawada, ADB's chief economist.
Although its growth outlook will slow relative to the recent past, strong consumer spending, fiscal support for infrastructure, and structural reforms to improve productivity in industry will keep China's economy on solid ground, he said.
Consumption will continue to drive growth in 2017, backed by sustained wage growth and increased government spending on health, education, and pensions. Industrial growth will decelerate in 2017 due to reduced investment with excess capacity, slowing real estate investment, and high debt, although consumer-oriented manufacturing will continue to have a positive outlook, according to the report.
Inflation is expected to accelerate to 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.8 percent in 2018, due to stronger consumer demand, higher wages, continued price deregulation, a weaker renminbi, and the increase in global commodity prices, it said.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Established in 1966, it has 67 members, including 48 from the region.

Caixin service PMI falls to six-month low in March

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's service sector continued to slow in March, as a private survey showed Thursday that an index for the sector fell to a six-month low.
The Caixin General Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 52.2 in March from 52.6 in February, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit and sponsored by Caixin Media.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 represents contraction.
The decline follows a drop in the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI to 51.2 last month from 51.7 in February. As a result, the Caixin China Composite Output Index, which covers both manufacturing and services, fell to 52.1 in March from 52.6 the previous month, the lowest number since September.
The readings of the Caixin indexes for March contrast with the official PMIs released by the National Bureau of Statistics, partly due to the types of companies included in the surveys.
Official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 55.1 last month from 54.2 in February, the highest since May 2014, while the manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.8 from 51.6 in February, the strongest reading since April 2012.
Services industries have become an increasingly important part of the Chinese economy, reflecting its shift away from traditional heavy-industry manufacturing and exports.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange market is now relatively stable, with cross-border capital movement gradually becoming balanced, the head of the country's forex regulator said Wednesday.
Speaking at a meeting with representatives from foreign investors, Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, struck a confident tone that China's cross-border payments will be "steady" in the future.
He said China's foreign exchange management will basically focus on reform and opening-up to facilitate cross-border trade and investment, and at the same time prevent risks from cross-border capital flows.
Stressing these as two "basic points," Pan said China's foreign exchange management aims to better serve enterprises and the real economy and maintain a healthy, steady and good market order.
A steady and benign market is in line with the common interests of both the regulator and market entities, and requires joint efforts from all parties involved, he said.

Service sector to account for 72 pct of China's GDP by 2030: gov't think tank

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China should promote the development of the service sector, which will account for 72 percent of the GDP by 2030, according to a government think tank report issued Wednesday.
The Chinese economy has entered a new period in which development is led by the service sector, yet the sector is still plagued by weak competitiveness and an unbalanced industrial structure, according to the National Academy of Economic Strategy (NAES) under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
China's service sector exceeded the industrial sector for the first time in 2013, reaching 46.1 percent of its GDP and signaling an improved economic structure. The proportion rose to 51.6 percent last year.
This came as the country has been trying to wean the economy off its over-reliance on exports and investment and pushing it toward a growth model bolstered by consumer spending, innovation and the service sector.
The NAES expected the service sector to account for 59 percent of China's GDP by 2020 and projected the proportion will grow to 66 percent by 2025.
To foster the sector's development, the NAES advised the government to further open up the sector, encourage innovation and enhance protection of investors' interests.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Xia Guangfeng, a businessman from Shanghai, still remembers the moment he made his first sale of American lobsters using an e-business platform.
"It was on December 27, 2012, and the buyer was from Bazhong city, Sichuan Province," Xia recalled.
"The order value was 292.5 yuan (42.39 U.S. dollars), and the delicate flavor of the lobsters won high praise from the customer," he said.
Over the last four years, Xia's aquatic products company has been selling American lobsters through several e-commerce platforms, with an annual turnover of more than one million yuan (145,182 dollars), while the daily sales of his physical stores have reached 1.5 million yuan (217,773 dollars).
In China, there is a large number of dealers who are engaged in American lobster businesses, just like Xia.
The Associated Press said in a recent report that in 2016, China imported more than 108 million dollars' worth of lobsters from the United States, surpassing the previous high of about 90.2 million dollars in 2014.
The market is growing so quickly, said Matt Jacobson, executive director of the Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative. In 2016, China bought 40.9 million dollars' worth of lobsters from Maine, where most of America's lobsters are caught.
The Chinese market is growing at an annual rate of 30 percent to 50 percent, he said, adding that the big market is becoming more and more important to them.
Affordable prices, improved logistics and the rise of China's middle class are believed to be the main reasons for American lobsters' quick entry into the Chinese market.
A series of related industries in the two countries, such as fishing, transportation, distribution and e-commerce, are also showing increasing vitality.
Annie Tselikis, marketing manager at Maine Coast Company, told reporters that her company could ship live lobsters by air to Beijing and Shanghai within 20 to 40 hours.
The quality of the lobsters from Tselikis' company is evaluated in the customer feedback on some famous Chinese e-commerce platforms like Tmall or Taobao.
Imported lobsters can be delivered alive to the majority of Chinese customers, including those living in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China. Comments like "Very fresh" or "Good taste" can be seen quite often in the customer reviews on those lobsters.
Jeff Bennett, senior trade specialist with the Maine International Trade Center, told Xinhua that Maine has opened an office in Shanghai to go after more Chinese investment.
While explaining the reason Maine set up the investment office, Bennett said the lobster industry, as one of Maine's key industries, has created big job opportunities.
The Chinese market witnessed the rapid growth during the past five or six years, Bennett said, adding that he believed the Chinese market still has great growth potential.
Behind the growing export of American lobsters to China is the fact that China and the United States have shared interests and have high stakes in each other.
China-U.S. trade volume grew from 2.5 billion dollars in 1979 to about 519.6 billion dollars in 2016, surging 211 times within 38 years, according to statistics of China's Ministry of Commerce.
Bilateral service trade volume totalled over 100 billion dollars while mutual investment exceeded 170 billion dollars by the end of 2016.
The figures were reached against the backdrop of a global economic slowdown and sluggish international trade in general.
"Under such circumstances, China-U.S. trade has seen growth, rather than a fall, which shows great potential for the development of both countries' trade and economy," Li Wei, a researcher at the National Academy of Development and Strategy at Renmin University of China, told reporters.
"The potential originates from the highly complementary nature of the two countries' economic structures. China ought to become America's most important economic partner," Li said. "The United States needs to fully understand that the increasing consumption level of the Chinese will stimulate America's exports to China. American people will perceive tangible benefits from China's economic growth."
Sonny Beal, a fisherman of Beals Island off Maine's east coast, said that he was grateful for China.
China's increasing need has largely helped the local lobster industry, he said.
Gerry Cushman, a fisherman from Port Clyde, also said American lobsters have not only appeared as cuisine on Chinese people's dining tables, but have also become a sensation on the Internet, which is a surprise.

BRUSSELS, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) regulators gave green light to ChemChina's merger of Swiss Syngenta with condition on Wednesday.
"ChemChina has offered significant remedies, which fully address our competition concerns. This has allowed us to approve the transaction," the EU Commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager told a press conference.
Syngenta is a leading pesticide supplier worldwide. ChemChina is currently active in pesticide markets in Europe through Adama, its wholly-owned Israel-based subsidiary which is the world's biggest producer of generic pesticides.
The approval came following a set of commitments made by ChemChina as the commission had concerns that the merger would have reduced competition in a number of existing markets for pesticides and plant growth regulators, said the European Commission, the bloc's executive body which overseas competition policy.
To win the approval, ChemChina has promised to divest significant parts of Adama and Syngenta pesticides and plant growth regulator business, said the commission in a statement.
The deal, worth up to 43 billion U.S. dollars, was reported to gain approval from the U.S. regulators on Tuesday.

Economic Watch: China's stocks rally on new economic area

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's stocks rose substantially on Wednesday, partly driven by shares related to Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index went up 1.48 percent to 3,270.31 points, the biggest daily increase in six months and reversing the bearish performance of the last week.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index closed 1.9 percent higher at 10,627.13 points. The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, rallied 1.88 percent to close at 1,943.16 points.
Combined turnover on the two bourses came in at 576.27 billion yuan (83.63 billion U.S. dollars), up from 463.6 billion yuan the previous trading day.
The strong indices came after central authorities announced the establishment of the new area on Saturday, which is a "major historic and strategic choice" that will be "crucial for the millennium to come," according to an official circular.
Of more than 3,000 listed companies, around 85 percent gained, with shares related to the new national strategy leading the rises, mainly in sectors such as property, cement, steel and construction.
Shares of more than 20 firms with business focused on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region surged by around the 10-percent daily limit immediately after opening, and maintained the status throughout the day.
China Fortune Land Development, a property developer that had reportedly signed development agreements in the area, jumped 10.01 percent to 29.99 yuan per share.
Tangshan Jidong Cement, a major cement producer in Hebei, and BBMG Corp., a Beijing-based conglomerate in property development, construction and furniture, also saw rapid share price increases.
Xiongan, some 100 kilometers southwest of downtown Beijing and now only covering three less-developed counties, is expected to create fresh business opportunities and help the capital city share its prosperity with surrounding areas.
Analysts believe the establishment of the new economic area will draw infrastructure investment and provide impetus to broader economic growth.
"Xiongan is an opportunity for regional fixed asset investment (FAI) and will have profound influence on both primary and secondary markets," said Guan Qingyou, vice president of Minsheng Securities.
UBS Securities analyst Gao Ting predicts FAI in the area will reach 4 trillion yuan in the next 20 years, with new room for the development of the cement, steel, rail transit and transport sectors.
After non-capital functions including technology, education and manufacturing are transferred to Xiongan, the area will become a market-driven, innovative and green city that can spur regional growth and help Beijing and surrounding regions develop into the third-largest city cluster in China, Gao said.
State Development and Investment Corp. (SDIC), China's largest state-owned investment holding company by fund volume, has already expressed its interest in the new area.
Addressing an internal meeting on Tuesday, SDIC chairman Wang Huisheng said the company will "put its ability to good use" and "strive to be a vanguard and pioneer" in Xiongan's development.
SDIC will exploit its advantages in fundraising to attract private capital and innovate the financing channels for high-tech emerging sectors, including underground pipelines, the health industry and smart cities, according to Wang.
But concerns are also on the rise as Xiongan and nearby areas have already been crowded with speculative home buyers from other parts of the country who are betting on surges in asset prices.
Guan suggested the government pay more attention to risks of overheated investment and rising debts.
Local officials have swiftly rolled out measures to curb emerging property speculation, temporarily shutting down real estate agents and freezing home purchases. Enditem

TIANJIN, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Tesla Motors China said Wednesday that Tesla delivered 25,000 electric cars globally in the first quarter, a quarterly record.
From January to March, Tesla produced 25,418 new cars, another quarterly record, the company said.
Of the cars delivered, 13,450 were Model S electric sedans and the remainder were model X utility vehicles. The two models are the two main existing models of the company.

Consumers select vegetables at a supermarket in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, March 9, 2017. China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, advanced 0.8 percent year on year in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Thursday. It was well below market expectation of 1.7 percent, and substantially lower than the growth of 2.5 percent in January. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Xiong Qi)
BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's inflation growth in the first quarter is likely to miss market expectations as food prices did not rise in line with projections, and the economy continues to pick up.
The average price of food in 50 Chinese cities continued to drop between March 21 and March 30, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Wednesday.
Prices of pork, beef and mutton declined from the previous sample period of March 11 to March 20, cucumber lost the most, dropping by 6.4 percent, and canola and soybean oil dipped by 0.4 percent.
The 10-day snapshot could reflect the direction in consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, as food prices account for nearly one-third of the prices used in calculating the index.
Weakening food prices are expected to drag down the March CPI, which is is expected to grow by about 0.8 percent year on year, according to a report by the Bank of Communications (BOCOM).
NBS data also showed market prices of important means of production, or raw materials, were mixed in late March, compared with mid-way through the same month, signs of slower growth in producer price index (PPI) for March.
From March 21 to 30, prices of 20 products, among the 50 monitored by the NBS, went up while those of 25 products dropped, and five remained flat with the previous set of March data.
Overall prices of non-ferrous and ferrous metals, chemical products, oil and gas as well as agricultural materials fell, except for several products such as zinc ingots, seamless steel pipes and caustic soda.
Otherwise, prices of coal products, agricultural products and non-metallic building materials either remained flat or rose in this period.
China's PPI, which measures costs of goods at the factory gate, rose 7.8 percent year on year in February and hit its highest level since 2008, but its growth is expected to fall back largely as a result of industrial capacity-trimming measures.
NBS spokesperson Sheng Laiyun expects CPI to rise mildly to narrow its gap with the PPI, dismissing concerns over expanding disparities between the two readings.
In Q1 2017, the knock-on effects of rapidly-rising PPI on CPI were not strong as the country continues shedding excess capacity, and the year-on-year growth of CPI is well below market expectations, said BOCOM chief economist Lian Ping.
China's CPI rose 0.8 percent year on year in February, substantially lower than the 2.5-percent growth in January, NBS data showed.
The next few months will see limited rises in CPI driven by structural factors, said Zhou Jingtong, a senior researcher with the international finance institute of the Bank of China, pointing to the larger share of agriculture products, over industrial items, in determining the index.
Annual CPI growth this year will be well below the official target of around 3 percent against the backdrop of subdued consumer demand, and prudent and neutral monetary policy, BOCOM predicted.
The official CPI and PPI in March are due to be released by the NBS on April 12, while the official GDP growth in Q1 is scheduled to be unveiled on April 17.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 51.8 in March, higher than 51.6 recorded in February, reinforcing signs that the economy is firming up. The index has stayed above the boom-bust line of 50 for eight months in a row.
China International Capital Corp., an investment bank, said in a research report that China's GDP growth could quicken to 6.9 percent in the first quarter from 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, citing pick-up in industrial activity and improving domestic demand.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's stock exchanges and securities depository and clearing authority are soliciting opinions on their new trading rules for institutions, which are designed to prevent errors that could cause volatility and even threaten the whole market.
The new rules aim to fend off abnormal transaction and settlement risks due to technical failures or "fat finger" trading incidents, according to the China Securities Journal.
Management on stock transactions on the own accounts of brokerages, fund companies and insurers will be improved, with a daily cap on buy orders to block abnormal transactions.
Trading of A shares, preference shares, bonds, warrants and repurchase agreements will be subject to the new rules.
Individual investors will not be affected, said a statement jointly released by Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation.
The move was considered a response to a serious trading glitch of Everbright Securities that resulted in a dramatic surge in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index on August 16, 2013.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Wednesday skipped the open market operations of reverse repos.
This was the eighth consecutive business day that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has halted the open market operations of reverse repos, a process where it purchases securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
The PBOC said in a statement that liquidity in the banking system was "at a relatively high level."
The government sped up fiscal spending near the end of last month. Fiscal expenditures mean fiscal deposits flow into commercial banks from the central bank, thus, improving market liquidity.
In the interbank market, the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, which measures the cost that Chinese banks lend to one another, dipped 1.02 basis points to 2.4868 percent on Wednesday, with the rate for one-week loans falling 3.80 basis points to 2.7400 percent.
China has pledged to pursue a prudent and neutral monetary policy in 2017, with the M2, a broad measure of the money supply, to grow by around 12 percent, one percentage point lower than the 2016 target.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The central parity rate of the Chinese currency renminbi, or the yuan, strengthened 87 basis points to 6.8906 against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
Chinese authorities have reiterated that the yuan will stabilize this year on the back of a firming economy and rising confidence in the country's growth prospects.
China's GDP growth is likely to accelerate in the first quarter of the year following a pick-up in industrial activity and improving domestic demand, according to a report by China International Capital Corp. (CICC).
The investment bank said in the research report that GDP growth could quicken to 6.9 percent in the first quarter from 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.
CICC expected China's retail sales of consumer goods to increase 10.2 percent year on year in March, accelerating from the 9.5 percent rise registered for January-February.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 51.8 in March, higher than 51.6 recorded in February, reinforcing signs that the economy is firming up.
In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shares rallied Wednesday partly driven by shares related to Xiongan New Area, a new economic zone to be built near Beijing.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index went up 0.41 percent at 3,235.66 points at opening, reversing bearish performance before the three-day tomb-sweeping holiday.
The smaller Shenzhen Component Index opened 0.65 percent higher at 10,496.78 points. The ChiNext Index, China's NASDAQ-style board of growth enterprises, was up 0.4 percent to open at 1,914.91 points.
The strong indices came after central authorities announced the establishment of the new area on Saturday, which is a "major historic and strategic choice" that would be "crucial for the millennium to come."
Analysts believe Xiongan, some 100 kilometers southwest of downtown Beijing and now only covering three lesser-developed counties, will create fresh business opportunities and help the capital city share its prosperity with surrounding areas.
More than 20 shares related to the new national strategy, mainly in sectors including property, cement, steel and construction, surged by the daily limit immediately after opening.
Shares in China Fortune Land Development, a property developer that had reportedly signed development agreements in the area, jumped 10.01 percent to 29.99 yuan per share.
Tangshan Jidong Cement, a major cement producer in Hebei, and BBMG Corp., a conglomerate in property development, construction and furniture, also saw rapid share price increases.
The new area is part of a more ambitious plan to jointly develop Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei to improve the region's economic development, environment and public services, and bridge the gap between the capital and areas surrounding it.

BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Sales of land for residential projects almost doubled in China's first-tier cities during January-March, according to the latest data released by China Index Academy, a property research organization.
Land sales in major cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, totaled 5.08 million square meters in the first quarter, an increase of 98 percent from a year ago, the highest level over the past two years.
Surging land sale is part of the government's efforts to cool down the runaway housing prices in major cities where huge demand and limited supply pushed prices to record high.
Major Chinese cities are taking fresh measures including increased minimum deposits for second-home buyers, adding to the slew of steps taken since October in dozens of cities to prevent home prices from rising out of control.

BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Ford (China) will recall 5,798 cars in the Chinese mainland due to problems with airbags, China's top quality watchdog said Tuesday.
The recall, starting on June 30, involves imported 2016-2017 Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Continental models, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in a statement on its website.

WELLINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's primary sector exports are forecast to rise 1.4 percent over the year to the end of June, with China being the biggest market overall, according to a government report out Tuesday.
Total primary industry exports were forecast to hit 37.5 billion NZ dollars (26.25 billion U.S. dollars) in the June year, driven by strong growth in dairy exports, said the report from the Ministry for Primary Industries.
"Strong global prices for forestry and dairy products, combined with rising horticulture production volumes, more than offset falling beef and lamb exports due to lower stock numbers in our latest forecast," it said.
As well as being the biggest overall primary exports market, China was the biggest market for exports of dairy, meat and wool, forestry, and seafood.
"Next year overall primary sector exports are expected to grow by 9.7 percent to 41 billion NZ dollars (28.7 billion U.S. dollars)," Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy said in a statement.
"It shows we have a strong and diversified primary sector with sectors like forestry and horticulture continuing to do well. It's also pleasing to see dairy on the rebound after a tough few seasons," said Guy.
"This year is likely to be more challenging for the sheep meat sector with market volatility and the UK's exchange rate fluctuations."

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's five largest commercial banks have posted small earnings growth in 2016 due to pressures on their net interest margins.
The banks are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB) and Bank of Communications (BOC).
Their profit growth ranges from 0.5 percent for the ICBC to 2.58 percent for the BOC. Their combined profit reached at least 900 billion yuan (132 billion U.S. dollars), according to the annual reports of those banks.
Compressed interest margins have led to lower interest income, a major source of profit for the big-five banks. Meanwhile, their commission charge revenues rose.
Insiders have predicted banks would face less pressure on their interest incomes as corporate credit demand was recovering.

NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) plans to woo Chinese investors in order to deepen the capital market, the bourse's top official said.
NSE CEO Geoffrey Odundo told Xinhua in a recent interview in Nairobi that currently there is very minimal Chinese capital at the NSE.
"We are therefore planning to conduct road shows in China in the coming months so that we create awareness of the NSE in China," Odundo said.
Over the past decade, Chinese firms have begun to play a prominent role in Kenya's economy. Odundo said that most Chinese firms operating in Kenya are either state-owned or privately held firms.
"By listing in the NSE, the Chinese can access long-term capital at cheaper rates," he added. The CEO noted that China has a high savings ratio as compared to Kenya.
"There is therefore a huge pool of Chinese funds that is looking for high returns that the NSE currently offers," he added.
The NSE is currently having discussions with Chinese investors who want to list their companies in African stock exchanges.
Odundo said that the Chinese have adopted a long-term view of Africa and therefore are seeking to grow their firms as the continent also grows.
Some of the advantages that Chinese firms will get by listing in Kenya are that they will gain more acceptance by local consumers.
The NSE has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Shanghai Securities Exchange in order to enhance knowledge sharing among the two exchanges.
Under the agreement, Kenya will be assisted to develop products that appeal to Chinese capital markets investors.
Odundo noted that some NSE personnel will also visit the Shanghai bourse in order to understand how the Chinese exchange has expanded rapidly in the past decade.

It also projected fixed asset investment to grow 8.4 percent in the first three months of the year, with the consumer price index rising 0.9 percent in March.
China is scheduled to release its first-quarter economic data, including GDP growth, fixed asset investment, industrial output and retail sales, on April 17.

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 live streaming apps have been closed for broadcasting illegal content, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced Sunday.
A number of app operators were punished for a lack of a mechanism to censor content. A number of anchors spread illegal content, dressed in military or police uniforms or were scantily dressed and acted flirtatiously, according to CAC.
Some anchors announced their WeChat or QQ accounts during live streaming to induce fans to engage in prostitution.
"The online behavior of the anchors violated relevant Internet information service or live streaming laws and regulations, offended socialist core values, and brought negative impact to the healthy growth of the young and teenagers," CAC said.
In November, CAC published a regulation banning the use of live streaming to undermine national security, destabilize society, disturb social order, infringe people's rights and interests, and disseminate inappropriate content, including pornography.
According to the regulation, service providers are obliged to censor content before releasing it and have a system that allows them to immediately block improper live streams.
CAC said it had previously joined hands with two other departments to blacklist 1,879 anchors who had severely violated relevant regulations and banned them from registering on live streaming platforms again.
The administration vowed to step up inspection and law enforcement.

CHONGQING/XI'AN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China takes free trade zones (FTZ) up to 11, with seven new FTZs starting operation on Saturday.
After an unveiling ceremony Saturday morning, contracts for 60 major projects totaling 80.2 billion yuan (11.7 billion U.S. dollars) were signed in southwest China's Chongqing FTZ, according to sources with the Chongqing Commerce Commission.
The signed projects cover various fields such as high-end manufacturing, finance, and international logistics services.
The unveiling ceremony of China Shaanxi FTZ was held Saturday morning in Xi'an Hi-tech Industries Development Zone. The newly established Shaanxi FTZ will consist of three areas, including the core area, the Xi'an International Trade and Logistics Park and the Yangling Demonstration Zone, covering a total of 119.95 square km.
"As the first FTZ in northwest China, Shaanxi will seek to develop cultural and economic relations with countries along the Silk Road while becoming a model for other inland regions," said Lu Shanbing, deputy director of the Silk Road Research Institute of Northwest University.
The State Council has approved the seven new zones in the provinces of Liaoning, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and Shaanxi as well as Chongqing Municipality, according to an official statement Friday.
China established its first FTZ in Shanghai in 2013, and expanded to three more provincial-level areas of Tianjin, Fujian and Guangdong. The new FTZs will bring the total number of zones to 11.

SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese firm China Rapid Finance filed an IPO application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday in a bid to go public in April.
Financial services providers Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and Jefferies served as the underwriters for the IPO.
Founded in 2001, Shanghai-based China Rapid Finance is one of China's leading consumer lending platforms, with offline and online lending channels.
In the past three years, the firm facilitated more than 10.7 million deals of loan, with a total value of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars, according to its application files.
In 2016, several of China's major online finance firms completed rounds of capital raising. JD Finance, a subsidiary of China's leading e-commerce platform JD.COM, was valued 6.7 billion dollars after raising capital. Ant Financial, Alibaba's online payment affiliate, collected 45 billion dollars and is valued at 60 billion dollars.
Analysts said improved regulatory policies would create more opportunities for financial services platforms to enter the market.

China Exclusive: "Reforms back our confidence in Chinese economy": Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Co-CEO

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Wei Sun Christianson has spent time as Morgan Stanley's China CEO for over a decade, and as Asia Pacific Co-CEO since 2011, giving her a unique insight into the rapid rise of the world's second largest economy and the following painful slowdown since the global financial crisis.
Despite the ups and downs, her confidence in China has remained unchanged, she told Xinhua during an exclusive interview. Christianson said this confidence stemmed from China's structural reforms and economic transition.
Regarding the launch of the supply-side structural reform drive, which began in 2016, she said there was enormous demand in China for upgrades to industries and consumption, which, she said "will help the economy maintain a medium-high growth rate over the coming decade."
Reforms in state-owned enterprises, land use, household registration and taxation will ensure the economy is sustainable, Christianson added.
In a lengthy report released last month, the New York-based investment bank predicts China will break out of the middle income trap by 2027, with its per capita income to reach 12,900 U.S. dollars to become a high income country, up from the current 8,100 U.S. dollars.
China is pushing for an economic shift from industry to services and from investment to consumption. It is already bearing fruit: Consumption contributed 64.6 percent of GDP in 2016, up by 4.9 percentage points from a year ago.
Christianson expects the ratio to continue to rise as incomes continue to grow. "China will have a 9.7-trillion-dollar consumer market by 2030, the largest in the world."
Given warming signs in the economy since the start of the year, Christianson said the timing is perfect for further reforms.
China saw better-than-expected major indicators in the first quarter, including trade and factory activity.
"Those indicators, including a rising producer price index, tells us that the economy is strong enough to bear reform measures, such as adjustments on the supply-side to cut excess production capacity," Christianson said.
The central government has reduced its growth target for this year to 6.5 percent, part of efforts to create leeway for economic overhauls.
"Reform will give the world a more stable China, not only a locomotive but a stabilizer of the global economy in the long run," Christianson said, "The progress may not be very fast. But it is steady and practical, and built on a solid foundation."
Christianson was one of the first Chinese students to study in the United States after China's opening up. After receiving the Juris Doctor degree at Columbia Law School, she worked overseas for years and was the first Chinese-born female executive of a Wall Street investment bank.
Encouraged by increasing opportunities from an opening China, she returned to take up the position of chief representative of Morgan Stanley in Beijing amid the Asian financial crisis nearly 20 years ago.
"China has kept a steady pace in opening up for years, and there have been substantial improvements in the business environment for foreign companies," Christianson said.
Despite the external risks, China has never hesitated in integrating into the world economy, with continued efforts to grant easier access for foreign investors.
Christianson expects reforms and opening up to bring opportunities to more foreign companies eager to increase their presence in China, one of the world's most valuable markets, citing China's fast-growing consumer market and service sector.
"For example, China's bond market is the most attractive to overseas investors, who are eager to enjoy the opportunities," she said.
A pioneer in the Chinese market, Morgan Stanley has witnessed the country's rise. It is about to celebrate its 23rd anniversary in China this year with its more than 1,000 local employees.

FUZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Free Trade Zones (FTZ) in east China's Fujian Province have received approval for international ship registration services, according to Fujian Marine Safety Administration under the Ministry of Transport Saturday.
Following the approvals issued to Fuzhou, Xiamen and Pingtan ports there are now eight FTZs capable of registering vessel ownership.The other ports are in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong.
Ship registration is the process by which a ship is given the nationality of the country to which it is registered, allowing vessels to travel internationally.
More than 663,000 ships sailed from or arrived at Fujian in 2016, of which 42,000 were international.
The move will attract more ships to be registered at Fujian FTZs, conducive to expanding the ship financing market and speeding up the development of ship service industry in Fujian.

China's central bank skips open market operations

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Saturday skipped the open market operations of reverse repos.
This was the seventh consecutive business day that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has halted the open market operations of reverse repos, a process where it purchases securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
The PBOC said in a statement that liquidity in the banking system was "at a relatively high level" as the government sped up fiscal spending near the end of last month.
Fiscal expenditures mean fiscal deposits flow into commercial banks from the central bank, thus, improving market liquidity.
In the interbank market, the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, which measures the cost at which Chinese banks lend to one another, climbed 3.14 basis points to 2.5384 percent on Friday, with the rate for one-week loans rising 2.90 basis points to 2.8500 percent.
China has pledged to pursue a prudent and neutral monetary policy in 2017, with the M2, a broad measure of the money supply, to grow by around 12 percent, one percentage point lower than the 2016 target.

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has approved IPO applications from ten companies, the same number as last week.
They will raise no more than 5.9 billion yuan (about 857 million U.S. dollars), the CSRC said in a statement.
Four companies will be listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, three on the Shenzhen small and medium enterprise board and three on the ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board.
The companies and underwriters will confirm dates after discussion with the exchanges.
Under the current IPO system, new shares are subject to approval from the CSRC, which controls both the timing and pricing. China is seeking to transform from an approval-based system to a more market-oriented one.

Caixin manufacturing PMI slips to 51.2

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A private survey showed Saturday that manufacturing activity in China expanded at a weaker pace in March as an index for the sector fell from the previous month.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 last month from 51.7 in February, according to the survey conducted by financial information service provider Markit and sponsored by Caixin Media Co. Ltd.
Caixin attributed the weaker expansion to new export orders that increased at the slowest rate in three months.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below 50 points to contraction.
The pullback in March's manufacturing PMI may temper optimism over the pickup in economic growth that followed better-than-expected data over the first two months of the year, according to the survey.

Alibaba wins more battles in anti-counterfeit war

SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba assisted police in busting more than 1,400 counterfeit production sites, leading to the arrest of 880 suspects last year, according to a report issued Friday.
The cases involved more than 3 billion yuan (435 million U.S. dollars), double the amount in 2015, said the report.
As of last year, Alibaba was cooperating with more than 18,000 international brands on the anti-counterfeit initiative.
Counterfeiting in cross-border trade has become a new front for the initiative, as approximately 30,000 cross-border sellers were purged by Alibaba from its platforms with the help of big data technology from February 2016 to the end of last month.
"Traditionally, counterfeiters produce in China and sell overseas, but now they are apt to produce abroad and sell domestically," said Zheng Junfang, chief platform governance officer of Alibaba.
One typical case, in which lubricating oil labeled under famous brand names, such as Shell, was bottled in Malaysia and sold in China, was solved with the intervention of the Malaysian government.
"The outcome was hard won," Zheng said, adding that crackdowns on cross-border counterfeiting are difficult given complicated law enforcement issues in different countries.
Despite Alibaba's continuous efforts to cleanse its platforms of fake goods, its customer-to-customer marketplace, Taobao.com, returned to the U.S. trade representative's blacklist of "notorious marketplaces" known for sale of counterfeit goods and violations of intellectual property rights in December 2016. Taobao was first put on the blacklist in 2011 but removed in 2012 after effective rectification.

IMF issues world's RMB-identified forex reserves for first time

WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund on Friday released data about the world's holdings of the Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB), denominated foreign exchange reserves for the first time.
By the end of December 2016, forex reserves which were identified in the RMB reached 84.51 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 1.07 percent of the world's total forex reserves, according to the data on the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves (COFER), which was released by the IMF quarterly.
It's the first time for the IMF to release the data about the RMB-identified forex reserves. Previously, the currencies identified in COFER were the U.S. dollar, pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and euro.
The IMF announced in last March that it would separately identify the RMB in its quarterly survey of the COFER from Oct. 1, 2016, and would publish the first data with the separate identification of RMB-denominated reserves at the end of March 2017.
This move recognized the continuing internationalization of the RMB, facilitated by China's reforms to promote a more market-based economy, said the IMF last March.
By the end of 2016, the U.S. dollar-denominated forex reserves reached 5,052.94 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2016, accounting for 63.96 percent of the world's total; the euro-denominated forex reserves ranked the second, with their share at 19.74 percent, according to the COFER data.
The COFER lists the currency composition of holdings of foreign exchange reserves across 146 reporters which consist of IMF member countries, non-member countries or economies and other foreign exchanges reserve holding entities.
The IMF published the COFER data quarterly and its members voluntarily participate in the COFER survey.
The COFER data for individual countries are kept confidential given the sensitive nature of the data.

Xinhua Insight: More free trade zones to open in China

Editor: Liangyu
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A third group of free trade zones (FTZ), including seven Chinese provinces and municipalities, will start operation on April 1, local authorities said.
The State Council has approved the seven new zones in the provinces of Liaoning, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and Shaanxi as well as Chongqing Municipality, according to an official statement released Friday.
China established its first FTZ in Shanghai in 2013, and expanded to three more provincial-level areas of Tianjin, Fujian and Guangdong. The new FTZs will bring the total number of the zones to 11.
The decision carries strategic importance in terms of opening up and reform, cutting bureaucratic red tape and exploring financial innovation, according to the statement.
Statistics with the Ministry of Commerce show more than 90,000 companies were set up in four trade zones as of 2015. In the first half of 2016, 4,923 foreign-funded firms were established in the four FTZs, with investment totaling 359 billion yuan.
The first two sets of zones successfully introduced a "negative list," which specified the investment sectors off-limits to foreign investors and allowed industries not on the list to follow the same new investment rules as domestic firms.
The four FTZs have attracted 10 percent of the country's total foreign investment and accumulated R&D power, entrepreneurship, e-commerce and trade projects, experts said.
PUSHING FORWARD NATIONAL STRATEGIES
So far, about one-third of Chinese provincial-level areas have FTZs. Five of them are in inland provinces and six are along the coast.
Observers said FTZs will help carry out major national endeavors such as the Belt and Road initiative, the Yangtze Economic Belt and the development of central and western China.
Liaoning Province will focus on reinvigorating the Rust Belt, an industrial area in China's northeast. Zhejiang is expected to capitalize on its e-commerce power and develop bulk commodities businesses. Henan will use its strategic location in China's heartland and grow stronger as a regional logistics hub. Hubei will spearhead the building of the Yangtze Economic Belt, named after the river that flows through the province. Chongqing and its neighbor, Sichuan, will be built in an inland area for opening-up. Shaanxi will seek to develop cultural and economic relations with countries along the Silk Road.
Li Qian, director of Chongqing FTZ management office, said Chongqing, through its efforts to build land trade routes with Europe, will help set the rules for land trade, as compared to trade via marine routes.
"An FTZ will get Chongqing more policy favors when it joins the international competition as a cargo trade hub," Li said.
"The plan for the FTZs reflects that China wants to build an open economy as a whole, but before doing that, it has to experiment with FTZs in different parts of the country," said Lu Shanbing, deputy director of the Silk Road Research Institute of Northwest University.
"The FTZs will not prioritize a certain area, rather, they will help coordinate development between the mid-west and the east and close the gaps," he said.
TAKING-OFF
Lei Hongli has worked at the Henan Airport Group for 21 years. When she started her job at the Zhengzhou airport, she had little occasion to use her English skills.
"There were just a few foreign planes. Mostly they were domestic flights carrying vegetables, animal hides and chickens," she said.
In 2016, nearly half a million tonnes of cargo were transported through Zhengzhou airport, and over 50 percent were international cargo, said Lei, assistant to the general manager of the Henan airport group.
"Henan is neither near the sea nor any border, so it has put up its strength to develop air transport," she said.
"Few international consignors knew about Zhengzhou a few years ago, but now it is one of the most popular airports for handling cargo," she added.
Wieger Ketellapper, vice president of Cargolux Airlines International, spends at least three weeks every month in Zhengzhou.
The company operates 15 flights a week between Luxembourg and Zhengzhou. In 2017, the number will reach 17. The planes bring in luxury consumer goods, fruit, car parts, aircraft parts, and helicopter parts to China and transport electronics, fashion goods and machinery parts out of the country.
"In 2014, we moved 15,000 tonnes, and the number reached 100,000 tonnes in 2016," Ketellapper said.
"The FTZ will be an important 'soft infrastructure' that will enable Henan to fully use its hard infrastructure," said John D. Kasarda, director of the Center for Air Commerce at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School and president of the Aerotropolis Institute in Zhengzhou.
Kasarda noted that there are three fundamental objectives for the Henan FTZ. First is capitalizing on its status as an international logistics hub. Another is leveraging high-end manufacturing and services to move up the value chain. The final aim is liberalization and deregulation of areas such as currency conversion and the free flow of capital, he said.
DIFFERENT APPROACHES NEEDED
Experts believe the key to the new FTZs, which are important for the opening-up of the country's landlocked central and western regions, is to find their own focuses.
"The first and second groups of FTZs are based in the country's most developed coastal regions. Their successful experience would not necessarily work for inland areas," said Xing Houyuan, deputy director of the service outsourcing research center of the Ministry of Commerce.
There is a gap between coastal and inland areas in terms of development and governance, and they have different favorable industries, according to Xing.
The coastal FTZs have proven effective in stimulating regional economies, but it could be a challenge for the third group, located in relatively backward areas, to attain similar effects, she said.
"We expect more specific policies to be made in accordance with the FTZ status in Henan and, more importantly, in line with the conditions and realities of individual areas," said Du Mingjun, an economics researcher in Henan.
"In attracting investors and trade, Henan, for example, has to look at its advantages and disadvantages and put its strength in places where it can develop best," he said.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC), one of the country's big four state-owned lenders, said Friday that its post-tax profit rose 2.58 percent year on year in 2016, with a slightly higher bad loan ratio.
The bank made 184.1 billion yuan (26.7 billion U.S. dollars) in post-tax profit last year, according to its annual report.
Revenue grew 2.48 percent year on year to 485.7 billion yuan.
The bank attributed the profit increase to a better income structure, improved operating efficiency and an accelerating international strategy.
Non-interest income accounted for 36.98 percent of income, up 6.33 percentage points year on year.
Overseas sections earned 12.2 billion U.S. dollars of profit before income tax, up 39 percent year on year and accounting for 36 percent of the bank's overall pre-tax profit.
Meanwhile, the bank saw outstanding bad loans expand 15.1 billion yuan year on year to 146 billion yuan at the end of 2016.
The bad loan ratio edged up 0.03 percentage points to 1.46 percent, but the increase was milder than the average growth for Chinese commercial banks.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nestle Health Science (NHSc) and the Chinese Stroke Association (CSA) announced a partnership Thursday that will seek to help stroke patients tackle swallowing difficulties.
As part of the collaboration, NHSc will roll out its thickening agent, Thicken Up, across leading hospitals in 25 provinces and municipalities in China.
It will also work with the CSA to introduce clinical innovation and best practice standards in China's leading stroke centers. For out-patients, NHSc has also launched an "Easy Eating" hotline.
It is estimated that 3.4-7.4 million patients are suffering from dysphagia in China, with strokes the greatest cause of the condition in hospital, according to NHSc.
"We are actively developing innovative nutritional therapies for conditions like dysphagia to improve patients'quality of life. China is a very important part of this and we are delighted to serve the market in China, its healthcare system and its people," according to Greg Behar, CEO of NHSc.
Cecily Gu, Business Head of NHSc Greater China Region, observed a clear evolution in the medical approach in China from addressing survival two decades ago to improving the quality of life now, especially the quality of life and mental health in the rehabilitation process.
Nestle Health Science's factory in east China's Taizhou City is expected to produce food for special medical purposes by the end of this year and the company is now working with a Hong Kong firm to develop products based on traditional Chinese medicine.

China to intensify auditing of state firms' overseas investment

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities made public a plan on Friday to step up auditing of overseas investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and strengthen supervision of state-owned capital.
The plan, jointly issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council, is aimed at helping boost the vitality, competitiveness and risk-resistance of state-owned businesses.
The country will enhance supervision over state assets through strict audits of SOEs, their overseas investment and state-owned capital as well as performance assessment of state company managers, according to the plan posted on the government website.
The country will also promote progress in SOE reforms, protect the safety of state assets and enhance capital returns, it said.
As of the end of 2016, total assets of China's SOEs hit 131.72 trillion yuan (about 19.1 trillion U.S. dollars), according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance.

China's external debt expected to grow, risks controllable

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's external debt will steadily increase in 2017, but associated risks are controllable, the country's foreign exchange regulator said Friday.
Outstanding external debt totaled 1.42 trillion U.S. dollars at the end of 2016, up 2.7 percent year on year, according to a statement from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
The debt has grown for three successive quarters as Chinese company deleveraging came to an end and authorities made cross-border financing easier, according to a SAFE official.
China saw a lowering of external debt between late 2014 and the first quarter of 2016, as Chinese firms repaid more debt to reduce risks, the official said.
Compared with the end of 2014, the country's external debt was down 359.3 billion dollars at the end of 2016.
The official predicted a steady rebound in overall external debt this year as China's economy maintains medium-high growth due to policies on structural transformation and industrial upgrading.
Despite an expected debt increase, the official noted that the risk remains controllable, pointing to major indicators that are well below alarm levels.
As of the end of last year, China's ratio of external debt to GDP stood at 13 percent and its debt service ratio was 6 percent, below the international alarm line of 20 percent for both indicators.
The ratio of external debt to export earnings was 65 percent, while the ratio of short-term external debt to forex reserves reached 29 percent, lower than the alarm level of 100 percent for both.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Seven new free trade zones will open in China on April 1, bringing the total across the country to 11.
The State Council has approved the seven new zones in the provinces of Liaoning, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and Shaanxi as well as Chongqing Municipality, according to an official statement released Friday.
The decision carries strategic importance in terms of opening up and reform, cutting bureaucratic red tape and exploring financial innovation, according to the statement.
The government hopes the zones will play a pioneering role, replicating the success of previous trial. The free trade zones should help promote the nation's key regional and inter-regional development strategies such as the Yangtze River economic belt development plan and the Belt and Road Initiative.
The expansion comes nearly four years after China's launched its first free trade zone in Shanghai to test a broad range of economic reforms, including increased openness to foreign investment and fewer restrictions on capital flows.
In late 2014, Tianjin, Fujian and Guangdong were approved to set up the second group of free trade zones.
The first two sets of zones successfully introduced a "negative list," which specified the investment sectors off-limits to foreign investors and allowed industries not on the list to follow the same new investment rules as domestic firms.

DALIAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's first commodity option, the soybean meal option, started trading Friday on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE).
As a financial derivative, a soybean meal option contract permits the option buyer the right, without obligation, to buy or sell the soybean meal at a designated price until a designated date.
The public trade of soybean meal options now means financial derivatives market does not only feature commodity futures trades in China, said Li Zhengqiang, the DCE president.
It also signaled progress in improving China's financial derivatives market system, said Fang Xinghai, deputy head of China Securities Regulatory Commission. "China will approve more commodity options."
The DCE, one of China's three commodity futures exchanges, has 16 futures varieties in agriculture, chemical engineering and energy minerals. Its trading volume ranked eighth in the global derivatives exchanges in 2016.

China Focus: PMI reports paint positive economic picture

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The stronger-than-expected results from surveys on China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors have added to a slew of upbeat data on China's economy.
China's manufacturing sector in March stayed above the boom-bust mark for the eighth month in a row, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Friday.
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 51.8 in March, higher than the 51.6 recorded in February. The reading beat market expectations and was the highest in nearly five years. In April 2012 it reached 53.3. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion.
It also marks the second consecutive month for the manufacturing PMI expansion to accelerate. Major sub-indexes, including production and new orders, all posted upticks, pointing to strengthened momentum, according to NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.
"China's manufacturing sector and the broader economy are likely to continue steady growth on the back of favorable macroeconomic conditions and rebounding foreign markets demand," said investment bank China International Capital Corporation in a research note.
A separate NBS survey released Friday revealed that China's non-manufacturing sector continued to expand in March, nearing a three-year record high.
The non-manufacturing PMI came in at 55.1 in March, up from 54.2 in February, with retail, airlines, courier services, Internet and software, finance, and insurance among the fastest growing service sectors.
STRONG START
" The Chinese economy has staged a strong start, which has laid a solid foundation for the whole year," said Bi Jiyao, deputy director of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research.
Friday's surveys came as Brexit and the U.S. central banks' recent interest rate hike kept global appetite for risk in check.
China's major industrial companies registered a 31.5 percent profit growth year on year in January and February, in tandem with improved profitability of their main businesses, supported by coal mines, oil refineries and chemical industries, according to NBS data released Monday.
The PMI surveys reinforced the message conveyed by increased industrial business profits and shed light on economic restructuring progress.
"High-tech manufacturing continued its rapid expansion, and some traditional manufacturing production and management conditions continued to be on the mend," Zhao said, adding that oil refinery, coking and metal smelting industrial all witnessed robust growth.
The sub-index for the high-tech manufacturing industry topped 54.2 in March, well above the 51.8 registered across all manufacturing industries.
China is seeking to transition to an innovation and service-driven economy from one heavily reliant on investment and exports of low value-added goods.
The service sector accounted for more than half of China's economy last year and the majority of growth, as rising incomes made hotel and travel services more affordable.
HIGH BORROWING COSTS
Not every figure was good news. Four in ten polled industrial companies felt the pinch from tight cash flows, while more than half of smaller businesses were troubled by difficulties of high financing costs.
In a similar vein, China's central bank Friday, for the sixth consecutive business day, skipped the open market operations of reverse repos, draining liquidity from the market, creating higher borrowing costs for investors. Higher operational costs normally translate into waning profitability.
In the interbank market, the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, which measures the cost at which Chinese banks lend to one another, climbed 3.14 basis points to 2.5384 percent Friday morning, with the rate for one-week loans rising 2.90 basis points to 2.8500 percent.
Authorities are putting the foot on the brakes to curb debt-fueled economic growth and house prices in major cities.

Kazakhstan remains Xinjiang's top trade partner, with a trade volume of 6.72 billion yuan, with growth of 77.9 percent.
Increasing global demand and depreciation of the Chinese currency are among the factors contributing to the trade growth, according to customs officials.
The central government and Xinjiang regional government have boosted trade through expanding trade channels between Xinjiang and its trading partners, improving transportation and investing in trade information systems.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's non-manufacturing sector continued to expand in March, nearing a three-year record high, official data showed Friday.
The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 55.1 in March, up from 54.2 in February, and staying above the boom-bust line of 50 for the sixth straight month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The official manufacturing PMI also expanded to 51.8 in March, NBS data showed.
Commercial activities in the service sector grew steadily to 54.2 in March, while the index for new orders rose for the second consecutive month in March, indicating growing market demand.
Retail, airline transport, courier services, Internet and software information technology, finance and insurance were among the fastest growing service sectors, while road transport, catering and property reported contractions.
The service sector accounted for more than half of China's economy last year and for the majority of growth, as rising incomes made catering, hotels and travel services more affordable for Chinese consumers.
Meanwhile, the construction sector expanded faster in March thanks to acceleration of infrastructure investment and development. Market confidence holds strong for construction activities in the near future, according to NBS.

China's central bank continues to drain liquidity from market

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Friday skipped the open market operations of reverse repos, draining liquidity from the market.
This was the sixth consecutive business day that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has halted the open market operations of reverse repos, a process where it purchases securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
This meant that there was no injection of short-term funds into the banking system, which led to a net cash withdrawal, as previous reverse repos matured Friday and siphoned 30 billion yuan (4.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the market.
The PBOC said in a statement that liquidity in the banking system was "at a relatively high level" as the government sped up fiscal spending near the end of the month.
Fiscal expenditures mean fiscal deposits flow into commercial banks from the central bank, thus, improving market liquidity.
China has pledged to pursue a prudent and neutral monetary policy in 2017, with the M2, a broad measure of the money supply, to grow by around 12 percent, one percentage point lower than the 2016 target.

China sees toy trade growth

SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China reported growth in both import and export of toys in 2016, which fortified the country's status as a major manufacturer and consumer of toys, a report published Thursday said.
Last year, China exported toys valued at 33.7 billion U.S. dollars, up around 9.5 percent year on year, while imports hit more than 1 billion U.S.dollars, a rise of nearly 23 percent from a year earlier, said the report from China Toy & Juvenile Products Association, citing customs statistics.
Trade and profitability of the toy industry remarkably outstripped light industry as a whole in 2016, according to Zhang Chonghe, head of China National Light Industry Council.
The association predicted that the market size of toys would reach 60.7 billion yuan (8.8 billion U.S. dollars) this year, an increase of 9.2 percent year on year.
Liang Mei, head of the association, attributed the trade growth to the country's new second-child policy, along with improved competitiveness of manufacturers and upgraded consumption.
China has more than 10,000 toy manufacturers with about 6 million employees. From 2011 to 2015, Chinese-made toys accounted for 73 percent of the toys bought globally.

China's current account surplus nears 200 bln USD in 2016

Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's current account surplus stood at 196.4 billion U.S. dollars last year, the country's foreign exchange regulator said Thursday.
The goods-trade surplus declined 14 percent from the 2015 level to 494.1 billion dollars last year, while the service trade posted a deficit of 244.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 12 percent year on year, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement.
The current account surplus last year accounted for 1.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the regulator said.
The capital and financial account recorded a surplus of 26.3 billion dollars in 2016, with a deficit of 300 million dollars for the capital account and a deficit of 417 billion dollars for the non-reserve financial account, said SAFE.
Reserve assets, most of which are foreign exchange reserves, decreased by 443.7 billion dollars last year.
In the fourth quarter last year, China's current account surplus stood at 11.8 billion dollars, down from 69.3 billion dollars in the third quarter, according to SAFE.
The country will continue to run a current account surplus, as well as a capital and non-reserve financial account deficit in 2017, SAFE said.
The goods-trade surplus will stay at "a certain level," while growth in the service trade deficit is likely to stabilize this year, it said.
Meanwhile, the deficit under the capital and non-reserve financial account will narrow, as economic improvement at home will lure more capital inflows, and domestic firms are expected to make more rational and stable outbound investment, said SAFE.
The regulator expected cross-border capital movement would gradually become balanced.
As a result of steady progress in the reform of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism, a more flexible RMB will facilitate two-way cross-border flows of capital, it said.

Guangzhou limits sale of homes bought within two years

GUANGZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou has restricted the resale of homes purchased within less than two years to cool the property market.
The new rule, which goes into effect Friday, allows home owners to resell a property, including both new and second-hand homes, only two years after they obtain the ownership certificate.
Under the rule, those who give a home to another party as a gift may not buy a new one within two years.
The new restriction came less than two weeks after other restrictive measures on purchases were unveiled.
Starting in mid-March, Guangzhou prohibited single adults (including divorced individuals) from buying a second home. Non-resident families are allowed to buy one house if they can provide personal income tax or social security records for at least five years in the city. Previously, the requirement was only three years.
The city also raised the minimum down payment percentage in some circumstances, though not for first-time buyers. Those who do not have a home in Guangzhou but have housing loan records must pay more.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's securities regulator slapped a 3.47 billion yuan (about 504 million U.S. dollars) fine on a company chairman for stock market manipulation, an all-time high for a fine.
Xian Yan, chairman of P2P Financial Information Service Co., formerly Shanghai Duolun Industry Co., will also be banned for life from trading on the Chinese securities market, according to the penalty decision announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Thursday.
Xian was found guilty of fixing the stock price of his company via insider trading and reporting falsely to the stock market regulator from Jan. 17, 2014 to June 12, 2015, according to the CSRC.
The amount of the fine received by Xian approaches the total of fines handed out by the CSRC for all of last year, which stood at 4.28 billion yuan, showing the regulator's determination to rein in risky stock behavior.

Confident Chinese travelers seek adventure in Australia

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese travelers are coming to Australia and seeking unique, personalized experiences, according to an authority with Tourism Australia.
"Chinese travelers are more confident, more adventurous, and more experiential, and they are making more local Australian friends as they travel. To me, this is the true spirit of friendship between two countries, manifested through rapid development in tourism exchange," Andy Jiang, China Country Manager of Tourism Australia, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
In a recent trip to South Australia, he met two young Chinese couples travelling through Port Lincoln, a beautiful spot on Eyre Peninsula.
"They were young, full of passion for travel, and were telling me great experiences that they just had -- tasting fresh oysters from the ocean at Coffin Bay, swimming with sea lions at Baird Bay, gazing at beautiful stars at night in the Flinders Ranges," he said.
"What we are seeing are more and more Chinese travelers are now going beyond the gateway cities of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, and they are travelling through some of the best regional locations in Australia and are having a fantastic time," he added.
China is by far Australia's fastest growing and highest spending international market, he said. It is also Australia's fourth-biggest market for international business events spending and third-biggest in terms of international business events arrivals, Jiang said.
In 2016, almost 1.2 million Chinese visited Australia and spent over 9 billion U.S. dollars, up 18 percent year on year. The China market has the potential to be worth 13 billion U.S. dollars by 2020.
Many of those driving the growth are affluent and independently-minded travelers who are young, inquisitive and have a sense of adventure. They are interested in the stunning natural resources, art and culture programs in Australia, he noted, adding that these have also become the focus of Australia's marketing campaigns in China.
To attract the country's young tourists, Tourism Australia has taken targeted measures such as using Virtual Reality (VR) and 360 degree videos to provide an immersive experience showing off Australia's aquatic and coastal attractions.
The year 2017 marks the China-Australia Year of Tourism and the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which Jiang believes will be a boost for promoting Australia as an attractive destination.
He pointed out that tourism is an important industry for both countries, bringing jobs and business opportunities to cities and rural communities alike.
As part of initiatives to mark the China-Australia Year of Tourism, Tourism Australia is working to implement a pilot ten-year visa for Chinese travelers, enabling them to apply online in the Chinese language. The milestone policy to open air space has significantly increased flights between China and Australia.
Many tourist attractions in Australia have increased their investment in the outbound Chinese market. For example, the Bridge Climb, a major attraction in Sydney, will launch tailored Mandarin guide services in April this year.
Following Premier Li Keqiang's official visit to Australia last week, the two countries agreed to build on the China-Australia Year of Tourism to organize promotional activities and encourage people-to-people exchanges.
"The more Chinese people visit our nation and the more Australians come here to China, the better we understand each other and the more opportunities we have for further engagement and cooperation at every level," he said.

China's new energy power waste worsens as capacity grows: report

Editor: Mengjie
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's capacity for wind and solar power generation continued to grow in 2016, but a larger percentage of electricity from these clean sources was wasted, an industrial report said Thursday.
The rise of abandoned electricity has affected the sustainable development of new energy in China, said the 2016 China energy development report, released by Electric Power Planning and Engineering Institute, a think tank under the state-owned China Energy Engineering Group.
China has been encouraging the development of clean energy sources in recent years to reduce the country's heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for about 72 percent of the energy consumption mix.
But a race to build wind farms in resource-rich northern regions has led to a serious problem of over-development. Output soon surpassed local demand and there are no adequate transmission facilities to send it elsewhere, or it is not economically viable to do so.
Close to 50 billion kilowatt hours of wind power were abandoned, accounting for 17 percent of the total generated wind power, up 2 percentage points from a year earlier. For solar power, about 20 percent of the electricity produced in the northwest region was also wasted.
"The waste of new energy power is a headache for China as a result of imbalanced distribution of wind resources and an imperfect grid system," said Liu Jizhen, academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
"More transmission lines should be built to make better use of the power generated," he said, citing the report.
China has the world's largest installed capacity of wind and solar power. They, however, account for only 4.9 percent of the country's total energy production mix.
The report predicts the installed capacity of wind and solar power to continue their rapid growth in 2017, but more will be located in the eastern and central regions where the demand is high.
It suggested that new energy power projects should not be approved in regions where more than 10 percent of wind power or 5 percent of solar power were wasted in the previous year.

MEXICO CITY, March 30 (Xinhua) -- JAC Motors of China has presented the first two SUVs manufactured in Mexico.
It happened after JAC signed an alliance with Giant Motors Latin America and the Inbursa financial group, owned by Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, which represents an investment of around 4.4 billion pesos (236 million U.S. dollars).
"It is significant for us to see our company enter the North America market, where Mexico plays an important and strategic role. We want to use this to gradually update our products and position the brand in a mature market with potential niche," David Zhang, deputy director-general of JAC International, told Xinhua on Tuesday.
The vehicles are being manufactured at a plant in Tepeapulco, in the central state of Hidalgo, which is expected to produce 10,000 vehicles over five years.
Zhang said that JAC products, especially light trucks, are already accepted in Mexico.
"We want to move forward step by step. First, we want to meet the demand of the Mexican market. There is a big market here and our SUV products are liked by young Mexican people, who will be our main consumers," he said. "We will then use this production base to extend our business to nearby countries, including all of Latin America and the Caribbean."
Jose Luis Romo Cruz, secretary of economic development for the state of Hidalgo, said this investment would put Hidalgo back on the international automotive map.
He said that China is a very important market for Hidalgo, which is seeking to bring Chinese investment toward the automotive, renewable energy, agricultural and aerospace sectors.
"The challenge facing our state is the same (as) all of Mexico is facing. We are at a stage where we are seeking the best way to diversify our markets and not rely only on the U.S.," emphasized the official. "We are more than ready to receive Chinese investment."

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Thursday skipped the open market operations of reverse repos, draining liquidity from the market.
This was the fifth consecutive business day that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has halted the open market operations of reverse repos, a process where it purchases securities from banks with an agreement to sell them back in the future.
This meant that there was no injection of short-term funds into the banking system, which led to a net cash withdrawal, as previous reverse repos matured Thursday and siphoned 40 billion yuan (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) from the market.
The PBOC said in a statement that liquidity in the banking system was "at a relatively high level" as the government sped up fiscal spending near the end of the month.
Fiscal expenditures mean fiscal deposits flow into commercial banks from the central bank, thus, improving market liquidity.
China will pursue a "prudent and neutral" monetary policy in 2017, with the broad money supply (M2), a key measure for liquidity on the market, projected to grow by around 12 percent. This is one percentage point lower than the 2016 target, according to the government work report, which was delivered at the annual parliamentary session earlier this month.
A recent PBOC survey showed that about 20.3 percent of bankers polled called China's monetary policy "relatively tight," up from only 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.

BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank Corp. said on Wednesday its net profit in 2016 rose 1.45 percent to 231.46 billion yuan (about 33.6 billion U.S. dollars), buoyed mainly by commissions and fees.
The bank's annual report showed its net interest income fell 8.73 percent year on year to 417.8 billion yuan, while net commission and fee income rose 4.39 percent year on year to 118.5 billion yuan last year.
The bank reported that its bad loan ratio fell 0.06 percentage point to 1.52 percent by the end of 2016.
Meanwhile, the bank's non-performing loans stood at 178.69 billion yuan.
By the end of last year, its total assets surged 14.25 percent year on year to 20.96 trillion yuan on increasing loans and investments.
The combined onshore assets of China's "big five" lenders -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Bank of Communications -- came in at 83.1 trillion yuan by the end of last month, accounting for 36.1 percent of the total assets in the industry, data released by the China Banking Regulatory Commission showed on Tuesday.
Agricultural Bank of China on Tuesday said its net profits rose 1.8 percent year on year to 184 billion yuan in 2016.

BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is likely to grow by 6.8 percent year on year in the first quarter of the year as production activities and investment picked up, according to a Chinese government think tank report Wednesday.
The firming trend in the fourth quarter last year has continued into the first quarter of 2017, according to the National Academy of Economic Strategy (NAES), citing a huge rise in factory-gate prices, rebounding corporate profits and increasing imports.
Consumer prices will rise by 1.4 percent in the first three months of this year, according to NAES, which is affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
"Despite downward pressure, China's economy has been operating in a good state," said Wang Hongju, a researcher with NAES. "The focus of macro-economic policies should be put in supply-side restructural reforms to boost potential output in the long run."
NAES estimated that China's economy would expand by 6.7 percent in the first half of the year as industrial production was likely to increase moderately in the second quarter, while investment would see slightly slower growth.
Consumption will grow steadily in the April-June period, but it will be difficult to find improvement in exports, according to the report.
The Chinese government trimmed its 2017 growth target to around 6.5 percent, the lowest in a quarter of a century.
The report said the Chinese government should guard against risks in the property and financial sectors by proper
